83-3,83,3,Poor,"6 Reviews , 1 Follower",Gautam,2,Chicken tikka burger is their best!! But very unfortunately they always give ketchup which is out of expiry date. This I believe is a very serious issue and I brought it to the notice of both Zomato customer care and the Snack hub as well. I wish to be taken very seriously and see that it doesn't repeat and our faith restored in you. I also took the ketchup sachets to the Snack Hub and they admitted to the mistake of theirs

So I go around places to try different pastries,so last weekend me and my friend went to have some chat near nallagandala fly over and after having some chat i wanted to have something sweet and I found out this place and gave it a try. Well the place was quite good. the price was also reasonable so, you can give it a try for sure."

Self service oriented. Shawarma too is available. Chinese Cuisine is yet to start. Parking for bikes is ample, for car parking is limited. Overall first visit to Snack Hub made us have an unique experience."
