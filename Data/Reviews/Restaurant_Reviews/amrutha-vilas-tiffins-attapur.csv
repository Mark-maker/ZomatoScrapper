97-4,97,4,Very Good,1 Review,Karthik Modugula,4,A clean place to have your breakfast and snacks. The taste of the food is just like it has been cooked in your house. The guys who put this has dedication towards this place. The choice of their name is interesting and they are up to the Telugu Sitcom ‘Amrutham’ standards in their hospitality and food and probably honesty too.

97-7,97,7,Poor,1 Review,Rajeshvvg,1,"We heard AVT is the good place to have food, we tried veg Manchurian but deeply dissapointed. Coz it is sweet as Jamun, may be some might like it. being south Indian I expect it should be spicy and crispy. But it's waterie and sweet as Jamun. Our dinner had ended with unsatisfaction."

Today the restaurant people actually have done an extra great thing than delivering good food. They have sent me a hand written note thanking me for continuously ordering food from their restaurant and 'Punugulu' as complimentary. Dear Shekar, you have been offering great food and service till now, and today you actually made my great by sending me 'Punugulu' , ah, I miss them. You need to include 'Punugulu' in your Menu for ordering online, just a feedback though. Have to go visit this restaurant to eat food there. Thanks again and All the best ! :)"
