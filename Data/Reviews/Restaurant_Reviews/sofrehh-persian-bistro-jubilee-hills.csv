It also had some veggies but the chicken patty was so thick, flavored, and delicious that we could only taste the chicken! And that's good for all carnivores, isn't it?üòÅ üëçüëçüëç What I really loved tho was the Murgh Kubideh Tokhmeh! Try saying it fast five times in row üòÑ jokes apart, minced chicken and cheese wrapped in perfectly cooked omelette with some extra cheese on top of the bread -- it just blew my mindü§§ it was so so good and hearty. The ambience is what attracted me and for a few hours I felt like I was in some other country. With so little they have brought a dark parking space to life! Kudos to brain behind the theme/decoration. Overall, I like the place and would recommend it if you crave for good sandwiches or just want to chill out with friends without having to pay a fortune on food. Rating: Quality - 4/5‚úî Quantity - 4/5‚úî Taste - 4/5‚úî Ambience - 5/5‚úî Service - 4.5/5‚úî Cost - given the size of the sandwiches, I think it's not expensive."

88-5,88,5,Legendary,"122 Reviews , 781 Followers",Sidhant Dhirsamant,5,"This is a small place tucked away between high rise walls, a bit difficult to notice, but once you see it, you can never go back. Atleast, that's how it was for me and my friend. We missed our directions to some other place and reached here, and boy it was worth. Like the say, the best things happen when you aren't planning for it. The place is adorned in shades of Blue and white and a few other colours might pop up here and there. It instantly creates a vibe as soon as you enter the lane, disconnecting you from the rest of the city. And the music they play, just adds up to that mood. Coming to food and drinks, there's just sandwiches and marmalades on the menu. And if you're a vegetarian, there's probably just 3 options to choose from. Regardless, of whatever you choose, it's good nonetheless, and filling as well. We had ordered in a Penir Olivieh and Murgh Pukh. This place is good to have conversations and spend a nice time with absolutely anyone."

88-12,88,12,Very Good,"25 Reviews , 47 Followers",Kulsum Begum,4,"It is situated in Jubilee hills, very easily locatable. It is a small parking lot space converted to a beautiful cozy place. The moment I stepped in, I was taken aback by the minimal beautification made to that place which was really very eye catching and the lovely music. This place takes you away from the city chaos and relaxes u. It just won my heart right from the beginning. . Now, it was turn for some food- we ordered Kubideh and murgh pukh. Kubideh is basically tangy lamb patties which is served hot and Murgh pukh is herbed chicken, potato and lentil patties served hot. I have never been a fan of lamb sandwiches, but Kubideh just made me a fan of it. This sandwich was so juicy and delicious, I was just lost in that yummy taste. Murgh pukh was also nice, but as compared to Kubideh, it wasn‚Äôt that great for me. It was somewhat dry kind of sandwich and delicious too. We had ordered 3 in 1 coffee which is instant coffee and cappuccino, these were also very nice."
88-13,88,13,Very Good,"88 Reviews , 387 Followers",Sreetama Pal,4,"This quaint little place tucked away in a by lane of road number 36 would instantly transport you to a completely different world, away from the hustle and bustle of the happening #36foodbelt... Tastefully done up in accents of blue and white, with quaint bird houses doubling up as planters, the setup here is an inspiration :) The food does not disappoint either. The beautiful sublime kubideh on foccaccia is a must try, so is the bastani ice cream about which I have heard great things but haven't tried yet (out of stock on the night I visited, is there NO god ?!). Now,the only reason for the less than 5 star is the other sandwich I tried. The potato omelette sandwich on my first few bites seemed to be the stuff of which comfort food dreams are made of. But a couple more bites down, I started finding it a bit bland. BUT, and this has singlehandedly ensured that I will continue trying out the food here, is the response of the management (Moiz) when I communicated this. Instead of hiding behind the usual ""we will keep this in mind"" spiel, he instantly launched into a description of why the blandness in that dish could not be combated in a fell swoop. And the discussion that followed regarding alternative ways of spicing it up was so so exciting for an amateur chef like yours truly ! These guys also offer variants of coffee (which I did not try) and are going to introduce a specialised and rare Iranian tea set up (which I am looking forward to). Pretty good value for money as well. 'Nuff said. Go down, grab some grub and enjoy a whiff of Persia :) ProTip - Google is slightly misleading regarding the exact location, the food truck is parked at an alley accessible through the #788 entrance and has its own parking and seating."

Would prefer sofrehh's sandwich over any other sandwich in whole world. They make their own bread and it's the best on the planet. I am regular customer here only because of their sandwiches.. I strongly recommend you to try sofrehh if you're in Hyderabad.

88-18,88,18,Legendary,"194 Reviews , 454 Followers",Eat Like Jo üë®üèª‚Äçüç≥,5,"Street food business has existed from a very long time in our country. We have experienced chaats, juices, quick bites from road side vendors and sometimes worry about hygiene, but the taste never disappoints us. Hyderabad‚Äôs food industry has been going through tremendous experiments with food streets across city and food trucks adding more value and diversity. In all this Sofrehh is a name to behold. Located in a beautiful and posh neighbourhood of Jubilee Hills, Sofrehh has a prime spot and may be the only food truck in that entire stretch. . The ambience of the place is so lovely with the pretty overhead lights over seating area. The theme is blue as they are all in festive mood. They serve gourmet sandwiches and it‚Äôs a Persian food truck, so the spices are yummy. Our orders were the Veg Falafel and Murgh Bozorgh. First thing you notice is the softness of the sandwich bread. It‚Äôs treated with oil again before baking and hence it turned out to be super soft and maybe the finest breads you taste. Falafel has patties made of chick peas with potato. It was delicious and when served hot they were absolute fun to eat. I really liked it better than the non veg Bozorgh. But Bozorgh was such pleasure and it had fewer patties than falafel. Hitting the right notes I recommend you guys to go out and explore this pretty little food truck. .

88-19,88,19,Very Good,"215 Reviews , 1850 Followers",Anusha Punjala,4,"Every time I pass by road no 36, this cute little food truck catches my attention. It's just so adorable. I love how very little space was smartly put to use to set it up and of course, the colour blue used to bring more emphasis. I went for a dinner food preview and with all the fairy lights it looked even better. The furniture and ambience are very easy going and homely and of course, the host/the owner/chef who came up with the menu and the entire concept (food truck) is very very hospitable and knowledgeable. He definitely knows his food well. It is all derived from his monther's recipes which as a family they've put together and the precision shows when you just have one bite of these brilliant sandwiches. The bread is soft and just melts as you chew and the sandwiches are also prepared on the spot and are served hot. so these are the things I've tried, 1. A 2 in 1 coffee - (Batsam - An imported coffee that comes from Dubai) I requested for a coffee with minimum or no sugar at all and this tasted amazing. I must say that its a better version of a straight-up black coffee. 2. Veg Falafel sandwich - The only vegetarian sandwich I've had. It was absolutely delicious. Perfectly made falafels served with some veggies. 3. Kubideh sandwich - Yummy Lamb patties served in-between very tasty and soft bread. 4.AOTA - All of the above sandwich - The best and tastiest one among all. A sandwich that has bread covered with an omelette, cheese and a filling of all meats combined. This sandwich is a no-brainer. A must try for sure. 5. Murgh Kobideh Tukhmeh - This is a chicken version of the Kubideh and is served with an omelette over the bread. 6.Dessert - Classic Bastani - Their in-house ice cream made by them from scratch, the flavours of saffron and rosewater are just impeccable together. It's interesting to see how these sandwiches are prepared, especially the ones that have omelettes over the bread. I will definitely recommend this place not only because of the quality of food that they offer but also for the passion they have to experiment and improve each day. I hope they keep it up and keep feeding us the yummy sandwiches and many more things to come as a part of their menu. bitesizedjournal.com"
88-20,88,20,Very Good,"2 Reviews , 8 Followers",Rohit Ratish,4,"Based on the recommendation made by a friend, me and my pals decided to stop by the sofrehh food truck in jubilee hills. The past experiences with food trucks have not been the best and to be honest, they've always been a little underwhelming and disappointing. Appearences and Comfort A - Visually appetizing Sofrehh is no different in design. It's a conventional food truck but what sets it apart in aesthetics is that it's parked in a little alley beside a building on the main road. The team has taken decent efforts into making the alley look festive and decorative. There's enough seating for over a dozen people which is fairly enough I guess. The lighting is fabulous, especially at night and the seating is moderately comfortable. The place, despite being open is neat, well maintained and doesn't smell bad. The traffic emissions luckily doesn't reach the seating are which doesn't turn off the eating experience. This food truck is strategically placed to give you the best experience that they can, so points for the effort. Da Food A - It's better than you expect The menu is not absurdly large or overstuffed which is how it's supposed to be for a food truck. Focusing on a few options and making them work is more vital. The menu is not large enough to confuse you and it's not too small that you are coerced to eat something you don't want to. There's an equal amount of sandwich options for veg, chicken and mutton options. As we went on a group, we made sure that we got at least one sandwich from each category and boy was it a treat. The cold veg sandwich was nothing special but it was one of the better cold sandwiches that I had eaten. It was large and serviceable and wouldn't disappoint you. As for the chicken sandwich that I was most looking forward to, it turned out better than I had anticipated. There wasn't too much grease, the veggies weren't overstuffed and the meat was just the right amount. It was decently cooked and the mild flavour gelled really well with the temperature of the toast. However, the stars of the show were the two mutton sandwiches we ordered. I was really skeptical of eating a mutton sandwich because I surprisingly had never eaten one. I didn't know how well it would work with a sandwich and I was minutes away from having my mind blown. The meat in these sandwiches were tender, smoky, flavourful and juicy. But most importantly, they really complimented the sandwich experience. These two sandwiches were the best I've had this year. But that's not saying much because I haven't had too manyüòÖ. Still, take my word for it. The food is good here. Sorry, I'm unable to name the dishes but they were the recommendations made by the owner. Be sure to ask him if you want to take my word and play it safe. We also tried out three samples of marmalade at his request. They were rich in flavour but I personally feel that they were overdone. One of the three was decent but I don't recommend that you go for either of the three. Stop somewhere else in the area to quench your sugar thirst. This place is for sandwiches unless you are actively seeking new marmalades. I wouldn't stop you if you are. The Servitude Experience A - Not concerning Again, service is not the selling point of food trucks. It's just a bunch of people in a cramped truck, squeezing through tight spaces and making edible stuff for you that costs money. There's a bunch of menus by the truck window and you're expected to walk up there, spend a few minutes going over the limited eating options, wrestle with your brain to make the choice and finally give in and tell the chef what you want. It's a simple process. However, there's some extra staff here and the owner's present too. They can even come up to the table if you want them to and they'll also help you with making a decision if that seems to be a problem for you. It definitely increases the overhead for a food truck but it's more convenient for us. My money though... A - It's a fair exchange Once you see the serving size of these sandwiches, you'll look up the 'shut up and take my money' meme and slap it on the truck counter while greedily eat the sandwich on your hand. While they're large, they're cut into even pieces that are convenient to hold and eat. And to top it all off, they're pretty good. We didn't get down to order marmalades so we don't know how much of it is offered. However they're more expensive than the sandwiches which average between 150-200. The marmalades are a tad bit expensive and based on the taste, I personally think that no less than a jar would be worth the money. However, there's a good chance that you might like it so do ask for a sample before you decide to order. Stand up for the verdict All in all, this was a good experience. It was open so late in the night and still we got a good dining experience. They were even tolerant of our bizarre antics and smiled through it all. The place is not a fallen fragment of heaven and could use a little improvement in each category but it's definitely done more than it is supposed to. Everything was good and I'll leave a score out of 10 which is more flexible than zomato's five star system. Score - 9/10 I do recommend this place. If you're suddenly craving a heavy sandwich for some reason, try driving up to this place. It's definitely worth it."

The ambiance was delightful despite the place being tiny (part of the credit goes to the Dean Martin songs playing in the background üôà). We ordered 2 sandwiches, one Penir Pukh and one Potato and Cheese omlette. I had high hopes but having turned pescatarian more than a year ago, I also deep down was thinking how the vegetarian sandwich would be just ok compared to the long list of meat options. The Penir Pukh came first and oh my god I was surprised. The bread was super soft, the patty inside was even more delicate making everything melt in mouth. One could definitely see that the time taken to make a sandwich was not compromised. The bread though soft was crispy on the edges and I think this would be the best bread I have tasted in a while. The potato and cheese omlette took a while but the music, the atmosphere, the weather as well as the aroma in that tiny enclosure lead to such amazing conversations that I did not mind a bit. The sandwich came with a very humble apology which frankly speaking was not even required! The potato and egg omlette was again a different experience all together. Any place that can serve something which is as lightly seasoned as that sandwich really trusts their cooking abilities and this place sure does. Loved every last bite of the sandwich. Then came the interesting icecream on the menu- Classic Bastani ( Persian saffron and rose water). I saw that on the menu and knew that I wanted it however consider it my luck that there was not enough left. The owner however was kind enough to scrape out the remaining bits and serve that to us so that we could atleast taste the ice-cream. And boy, what an amazing way to end the meal. Me and my husband had a wonderful time here and going forward this is going to be our favourite date-night spot for sure."

Exactly what happened with the Sofrehh They have got mom's fortune recipes of delicious Persian sandwiches, which you won't get anywhere across the country for sure and the sofrehh has a huge success. With all the blessings of their mom, they got an idea with crazy passion to open a food truck at any corner, but there were not satisfied to standing at corners of roads, as they deserved the better spot a best place, and then they came up to an brilliant idea to turn out the food truck into a bistro and find this parking space and transformed it to a wonderful bistro at 788 Avenue Road No: 36 Jubilee hills.

88-26,88,26,Legendary,"214 Reviews , 2941 Followers",Kamaal Ahmed (zaiqebaaz),5,"When i want to have a quick bite, i always stroll around my own vicinity because a ""quick"" bite has to be quick literally! But the foodie in me can take me anywhere if the content is worth going the distance. Even then, if someone tells me there is a food truck at 36, Jubilee hills that serves great sandwiches, i don't think i would be excited. Because one, i am not a fan of sandwiches and two, 7 kilometers for a sandwich is not my ideal quick bite! But then, there are places that beat me with excellence. I have given up on my oldest habits and destroyed my own austerity giving in to these innovative and flawless ideas! Sofrehh is the latest myth-buster in my life. A food truck that serves high-quality sandwiches is all it sounds like but just one look at the place was all it took to convince me this is not just about sandwiches! The way this place has been set up and decorated only shows the vision of the man behind this mesmerizing place, Arash! He knew its going to work, i don't know how! I took my own sweet time to visit Sofrehh because i wanted to see how people receive it. As expected, it was a huge hit within weeks of its opening! So finally when I got a chance to visit the place that i had seen a hundred times on FB and Insta, the Deja Vu was hard to avoid but then it was the food that played the role of surprise element for me. I had read enough about their Gourmet Sandwiches but they still surprised me with their never-before ingredients and flavors. We started with Batsam Coffee that they are importing all the way from Dubai. As expected, it was one strong, refreshing coffee that can't get better. The first Sandwich that came was a Koubideh Sandwich. The first thing that catches your eye is the Bread that is used. Besides looking Gorgeous, the bread was super soft and fresh. Koubideh Sandwich comes with a tangy lamb patty and a lot of other green goodness! It was a fresh new experience for my palate! The patty was softer than our Shami kebab and was juicier! Overall i loved the start! The next one was Murgh Kobideh Tukhmeh which had a chicken patty and was topped by an omelet! It had a soothing buttery taste and the chicken patty was so lite, i felt I'm eating a veg sadnwich Next was Veg Falafel Sandwich, a vegetarian's delight! Fully loaded falafel Sandwich that just fills your mouth with a hundred flavors. One would suffice for a lunch or dinner. Then came the big momma of them all, the sandwich that is named ""AOTA - All Of The Above"". As the name suggests, this bad boy has a little of everything on the menu, making it a giant of a Sandwich. You have to be born with a great appetite to savor this humongous sandwich. Its a double-decker that comes with Minced meat filling, ot of cheese, an omelet among several other fillings! This one was my star of the evening. Don't miss this one!. Ended the Persian feast with their amazing rose and cinnamon flavored ice cream. Overall it's a place you cannot afford to miss. This place deserves a place in every list of ""Things to do in Hyderabad"""

That it is a foodtruck registers quite late into my mind, you actually feel like you were transported into a street in a different country (Iran). Kudos to the designer, what a brilliant use of space. This is the place if you want to take someone special to, the ambience is just that lovely. Coming to the food, the taste pallete is definitely in for a lot of new variety. We ordered 3 main courses ‚Äì Veg falafel (beautifully done), Murgh Purkh (my husband‚Äôs favourite) and their classic Chicken-egg-cheese sandwich(my fav). The bread was very soft and rich with a lot of addons, the stuffing in all was fresh and healthy. I personally cant get enough of the chicken-egg-cheese sandwich. One could wish for more drinks to compliment other than their coffee. Loved their classic bastani icecream. Like I said before, the tastes are all unique, definitely worth trying. Don‚Äôt waste your time in waiting for a right day to check this out, the place itself will brighten up your usual boring weekday ‚Äì it did to me!

Located on a prime location next to #788 Avenue,it is very easy to locate. Even though it is a food truck it will always be parked at this location.

88-32,88,32,Legendary,"117 Reviews , 435 Followers",Ashok Prabhakaran,5,"Recently attended a food festival at the HiTex exhibition center last week named Bring Your Own Belly (BYOB). I went around lunch time to try much of the stuffs on offer. I was scouting a lot of stalls and the food trucks out there. There was this blue colored truck at one corner which was hogging most of the crowds. It looked one of the popular stalls out there in the event. I was silently checking it out and the menu wondering what to order. The owner (didn't know his name but he was a really cool guy though) came to my help and helped me out with the menu. I ordered for a Murgh Kubideh Tokhme. Absolutely didn't have any idea how it will be like taste and look wise. Got my order delivered after some 10 minutes. Considering the crowd, it was rather quick I would say. Just the first look of the sandwich would make one drool. It was wonderfully made. The Murgh Kubideh is a Chicken & Egg sandwich along with cheese made in their custom bread. It was one of the most awesome sandwiches I've had. Tasted so nice and was just silken smooth. Don't be deceived by the size of it, it fills you up pretty well. Wish I had more space on my stomach that day to try out their other items.

Well Sofrehh is exactly that to GastroHogger. Two failed attempts to try their gourmet sandwiches as they sold out, today destiny made Sofrehh the destination. Enough has been spoken about their gourmet sandwiches, simple and classic ingredients, amazing flavors and still pocket-friendly. I now can officially vouch for it as well. tucked inside the building at Daily Dose Bar in Jubilee Hills, this gem of a food truck is setup that's as inviting as it gets minimalistic decor, cute light arrays, blue everywhere and very well lit more like European by lane on the street cafes. Full score for keep it simple n ample. Tried the following (in order my crav(z)e levels: #TheAOTA aka ""All Of The Above"" is amalgamation of egg, chicken and cheese and potato - Its a gastronomical symphony.. Taste it to believe it #Kubideh - Favorite among crowd, Tangy lamb patties based sandwich and this was classic and amazing flavors. You gulp them in a jiffy #MurghKubidehTokhme aka MKT - Persian style minced chicken egg sandwich with cheese. I mean this was the most silkiest sandwich your palate get to romance. Alongside were hot n super fresh #Cappacino and to finish it off in style #BastaniSonnati - saffron and rosewater flavored ice cream. After those hot n guey sandwiches,this one cools your palate and your inner soul from first bite. IF you think the quality, quantity, ingredients, keeping it simple is what makes Sofrehh it is, wait till you meet the man behind the wheels Mehdi Arash Naseeruddin. His energy and excitement is infectious and a chat with him sipping a pipin hot cappucino and grab a bite of their sandwich, it becomes a memory and that to me is icing on the cake kind of experience. Overall Sofrehh has sure trying to perfect their recipe of success and I pray it to become ""LEGENDARY"" gourmet sandwiches in the land of Biryani and dilse Nazar na lagey <3 gastrohogger.com"

Vibrant colours and lovely succulents. I even like how neatly they are served Cutty Murg - Olive bread and chicken with herbs, were so succulent that I got lost. Mild on spice but still oozing flavour. Marmalade sandwich - I choose Apple Marmalade to go with it. Man I loved it. The bread goes soft outside and gives a crispy buttered inner side with marmalade. I loved it. Portions are good and was full instantly. Definetly coming back for more Sandwiches and Batsam coffee. This place sells Marmaldes too."

The ambiance of the place is very nicely designed with good use of blue and white along with cane furniture and stone pavement. The kitchen being in a truck makes it a food truck style outlet. The overall setup is very praiseworthy. The place offers a variety of uniquely made sandwiches that are in special breads which have olives in them. Kubideh is a toothsome sandwich with their secret sauces and chopped lamb which makes it delicious and made me loose myself in it. Murgh Pukh and Seebzamini Mozzarella were really good and they were really loved by our group when we visited this fabulous place. Murgh Pukh was a chicken patty filled with great flavours while Seebzamini Mozzarella, as the name suggests, was filled with layers of cheese. We ended our meal with their signature Bastani Ice Cream, which is a unique blend of milk, right amount of sweetness full of saffron threads and topped with crushed pista. It was incredible! I loved this place a lot, it reminded me of my time back KSA. But only the flavors though, The exact combination of items was a first for me and it was just amazing.

When I reached, I was simply amazed. The place is just fantastic! I had gone with a few friends, and we all really loved the overall look and feel. The place gives you Persian vibes with outdoor style seating. The kitchen is in a food truck which is quite a new concept. Blue is their signature color and you can see a lot of it. But they have used it very well in combination with cream and light browns. It was also raining, so our experience was enhanced. We ordered Murgh Pukh, Cutty Murgh, Kubideh, Shah Pukh Seebzamini Mozzarella and Veg Falafel. Murgh pukh was something new; it contained herbed chicken, potato and lentil patties. It was really good in taste. The coated bread was really perfect and filled with vegetables and sauces. Then we moved to Cutty Murg, which became my favroite. The chicken was perfectly cooked with well balanced spices. In between I got up and took a walk around the place. I had a chance to look at the making of all, and it was very good in authentic Persian style. Kubideh was there signature dish and it is a must try. It was just yumm! Perfectly marinated and juicy. Then we had Veg Falafel. I and my friends have had it at many places, but this was something else. I would recommend all to have it. By this time we were all full, but they brought Seebzamini Mozzarella, which is a famous and most selling dish. Coated with cheese and filled with crispy potato and egg. If you are a cheese lover then you should definitely try this. We ended our meal with their handmade ice-cream Bastani Sonnati. It was made with Pesian saffron and rose water. It was a perfect dessert. Before leaving we had a chance to talk with Mr. Arsh about the dishes and also the restaurant and their story. It was a nice talk. Thanks to Mr. Arsh and Mr. Moiz who had taken care of everything, we had a wonderful time and a fabulous dinner."

The ambience is just fantastic with chill vibes through great use of blue and white. Kubideh cravings got my squad to this chic place last night. The moment we got in the lane where Sofrehh is located, we felt as if we were somewhere in Europe. The setup is commendable. Coming to the food, we ordered a couple of Kubideh Sandwiches ofcourse followed by a few others namely Cutty Murgh, Murgh Puk, Shah Puk, Veg Falafel and their new addition Seebzamini Mozzarella. Kubideh Sandwiches were outstanding with amazing spices and various sauces which made it so good. Special mention to their bread which is equally good and has olives on it. Murgh Puk and Seebzamini Mozzarella were the other two which became an instant hit among our group. Murgh Puk is a tender chicken patty filled with flavours in the same bread while the Seebzamini Mozzarella in my opinion is the best of the lot as I never had anything like it before. It contains egg, two levels of cheese, some meat, a few veggies and to top it off a lot more grilled cheese on the sandwich which makes it mouthwatering. We concluded our feast with their special Bastani Ice Cream. Absolutely loved it. Gem of a place in the alley's of Jubilee Hills. Definitely going back to have their epic sandwiches."

Coz the bread will then kill the flavour as it in itself is so bland. Cutty Murgh The chicken patty had Mild flavours. But didn't stand out as a whole and disappointed me highly. Shah Pukh The lamb was very viscous, may be that's how the recipe is but it was very bland. Clearly the marinade didn't release the flavours. Sad sad Falafel. This was the only saving grace. The patty managed to shine out inspite of the fat bread. Never ever."

When I first saw the food truck, thought I shall go there someday and when I heard good reviews about their sandwiches, I wanted to grab a bite ASAP. I kept searching for them on the old spot, ended up disappointed for few days.Fortunately, I got to know that they have moved to another place. One day, after looks of searching,I found the address and I was amazed as I walked into the lane, where the food truck was parked at the end of the alley. It had quite an amazing ambiance, it has made the whole search experience worthwhile. With lights and frames and small planters on the walls of the alley, it kinda made the place quite festive and beautiful. As I sat there checking the menu, the host greeted me and asked me whether I was a first timer and whether I would like a veg or non veg sandwich. He is quite helpful, in suggesting me their most loved sandwich in both veg and non veg. I have decided to take KUBIDEH (non veg) and a cappuccino and was enjoying the evening breeze and vibe in the alley. When my order came through, I can still remember the first bite of KUBIDEH. It was quite delicious and fell in love with that sandwich and decided that it would definitely be on my last night food craving list from now on. As I ate my sandwich, I have seen people waiting for their orders to come, by making conversations. I believe with an delicious food, the hosts have careful put in their best in creating the ambience to bring in a positive and wonderful vibe to the place. As I was eating my sandwich, Hosts have personally asked for my opinion on their sandwich and suggested to try their other sandwiches too. As I left the place, with a delicious meal and good vibe. I personally congratulated and complimented them, for the food and the ambiance. Told them that I would certainly visit them soon and try their other sandwiches. I have been there numerous to date, The hosts are such an amazing people. One late night, he personally done an sandwich , after his closing time, because he didn‚Äôt want to send me away hungry.

The pretty lights and the cozy alley with the cobble stone pathway had me feeling like Id turned the corner and walked into a little bit of Europe. The soft music in the background felt so romantic. We ordered three sandwiches The Kubideh- Lamb patty in an olive bread with pickled cucumbers and tomato slices. The Lamb patty had a meat ball like consistency. The murgh oliveh- Cold sandwich made of paprika bread stuffed with shredded chicken, peas and corn, potato etc. Shah pukh- Super soft chicken patty with texture similar to a galouti kebab but with a completely different taste. With tomatoes and pickled cucumbers. The breads were softer than a baby's bottom. Absolutely fresh. The sandwiches almost melt in your mouth. Each sandwich is labelled with a sticker so you don't get confused. They also have imported instant coffees. Black coffee- Pretty good and Basic Cappuccino- Loved this one. Their signature ice cream Bastani Sonati with rose essence, saffron and pistachios was absolutely delightful. A unique flavour. Must try. Verdict- This was my first experience with Persian food. I loved how the herbs and spices didn't overpower the flavor of the meats in the patties. The sandwiches are light and easy on the tummy. Quite filling too.

The place: The tungsten lights, the blue and white combination with simple wooden furniture, the canopy when it rains, the stone floors makes it an absolutely beautiful place to be at. The things they serve: Not a huge menu but absolutely effective - Hot and cold, Veg and Non veg gourmet sandwiches , Maramalade( no preservatives) , Coffee's and Ice cream( on availability) Having taken a break from Zomato for a long time and just uploading pictures I was wondering what place deserves a review and here is Sofree - One strong recomendation after a hazaar visits at all the odd hours and it has delivered everytime. If you are a Vegetarian - Do try the Falafel sandwich ( Foccasia kind of bread) and ask for extra mayo sauce and you will love it. They have another Masala bread( red paprika on a very soft bread) that literally melts in your mouth. try the Pennir Sandwich on that. If you are a fan of heavy cold sandwiches give the Penir Oliveh a try. Separate veg and non veg grills to respect the sensitivities of people is a big plus. They have readymade coffee's too with 3-4 varieties which come in a heat proof plastic container and taste good.( Water based). But then if you plan to end your meal with a dessert they have their secret weapon which is not on the menu the saffron based ice cream with rose water and topped with Pistachios which will blow you away. It is home made and does not have preservatives as well which makes it even more appetizing. Priced perfectly( 200-250Rs), beautiful place, food presented really well with clear marking of the dish name makes this one of the few places which has got its game absolutely spot on. They are available on food delivery apps as well for convenience. Do try them! I wish to give them 4.5/5 but Zomato does not have an option üôà facebook.com"

It's a small cafe set up in a truck which operates in a narrow lane. But keeping the limitations in mind they had turned this small lane into lanes of Italy. Where u have such small cafes with small seating for groups and music being played in background. Coming onto the food. We order sandwiches. Cuttymurgh and Veg falafal were the best of all the 4 different sandwiches we ordered. They us focaccia bread for there sandwich. Coffee which they serve is Batsam instant coffee, it's good. But the best part which I truly like was the courteous nature of the owner or person who was there looking after. They are perfect host. PS: It's has simply become a place where I wld definitely like to visit more often."

I was here around midnight, so that's an option incase you would like to try something at that hour. It's filling and something unlike any others.

88-83,88,83,Average,"11 Reviews , 7 Followers",Saad Khan,3,"I went for a late night snack to Sofrehh on recommendation of one of my cousin. The place is very well lit up and has great ambience with jazz music playing in the background. We ordered 3 different types of non-veg sandwiches - Cutty Murgh, Kubideh and Shah-pukh and a coffee on the owner's recommendation. The rest of us were fine with cokes. The only sandwich that was okayish was Cutty Murgh, as both the lamb ones were just not worth it. And mind you all these sandwiches are pretty highly priced. I personally would pay around 150ish for the kind of sandwiches we ordered as I felt 200 plus is a bit high for these sandwiches. And the coffee my friend ordered was just not worth 90 bucks. It is basically an instant coffee which is imported from Dubai. Nothing extra. So in short a a decent place to have a late night snack when nothing else is open. PS: The bread of the sandwiches is really nice and they bake it themselves."

It's a small alley on the left just before #788 Avenue. Car parking is a little tricky. Must try are lamb Sandwiches; especially kubideh; It's just the best. The place is really pretty with all the lights and the truck. The owner is nice and friendly. He keeps a neat place and plays some good music. I'd be here more often if it were closer to home. Just the one feedback is I'd recommend the cooks to use gloves. That's all. We went as a group and all of us had a good time. Once this place gets really popular, it may be a tad difficult to find a place to sit and eat."

It was all over my Instagram suddenly, and was too tempting to pass. Sure enough, the place was just as I had pictured to be in my head from the photos. üá¨üá∑Although promoted as a Persian bistro, it felt Greek owing to the use of subtle blue and white shades. Comfortable seating, under the evening sky and adequately bright incandescent hue from the bulbs created the most beautiful atmosphere! üòç This was made complete by the mellow Jazz playing üé∂. The best part for a first timer trying a new cuisine? The small menu. It was quite easy to order, after actually understanding the differences. I had: ü•™ CUTTY MURGH - Soft and juicy ground chicken, herb marinated stuffed between a heavenly Olive Focaccia bread, along with some veggies and mayo. ü•™ SHAH-PUKH - Everything exactly the same, with mutton in place of chicken. It tasted slightly different, and unique. From what I learned, Sofrehh bake their own bread, without the use of any artificial preservatives and chemicals. This was evident in the smooth texture and melt in the mouth of the focaccia breads! üçû Another thing appreciated is the eco-friendly nature of operations. Open cardboard boxes used to serve, and paper bags for takeaway! ‚ôªÔ∏è The location and timings are perfect to say it's one of those places that truly adds an element to Hyderabad's nightlife! üïë Great place to grab a gourmet sandwich or some coffee on the run, or just sit down and unwind amidst the calm. üòå They have homemade marmalades and ice creams which I hope to try on a subsequent visit. üç¶ A suggestion would be to include half portions. Even though 220-240 is a reasonable price for a filling meal, half portions would be great! üòÉ It was great chatting with Mr. Mois who was the owner/ manager. Cheers for the great service and time! üçª Here's my overall SCORE: Food - 4.5/5 (meat:bread ratio could be improved) Ambience - 5/5 Service - 5/5 VFM - 4/5 (half portions please!)"

They modified the alley or the lane so beautifully. Everything is well put and so color coordinated and I quite liked it. I haven't had this amazing gourmet sandwiches ever. I've tried two of them. Cutty murgh and Shah-pukh. I really liked both of them. But I really have to say about the Shah-pukh. It has the lamb patties. I don't really prefer lamb on a regular basis. But I just loved it. The meat was spiced, seasoned and cooked perfectly. The patty just melts in your mouth. I'm not at all exaggerating. You should not miss this when you visit them. I did like the Cutty murgh but Shah-pukh stole the show. I was not able to try the others because one sandwich is totally enough and is so fulfilling. Yes, I did not eat two of them on my own. I did share half from each with the other person. And I'm definitely going back and trying the other the menu."
88-93,88,93,Very Good,"99 Reviews , 866 Followers",Raghu Chandra Prodduturi,4,"Tucked in the corner of what seems like a nice little alley, Sofrehh is first-of-it's kind that I have been to where a food truck that could turn a parking space into an open air, cozy and cute little restaurant (almost!). Following the greek style of blue and white spaces, it gives a pleasant feel. Coming to the food itself. Having a limited menu actually made it quite easy to choose but I do hope they keep changing/adding stuff else it's going to be difficult to create sticky customers. As me and my wife are not a big fan of cold sandwiches we both opted for veg falafel. Served in a cardboard plate, we got two pieces of veg falafel nicely wrapped and labelled (good job guys, avoids confusion of all sorts). As soon as the food was served we felt it was quite expensive for a small place but luckily the food was quite filling for the both of us. All of a sudden we are served with two more pieces of the veg falafel, baffled we were. Then we realised that one portion has two pieces and our tummy was full with just one portion, now we felt the price was quite justified. Coming to the taste, the olive foccacia used for veg falafel was buttery, soft and almost melted in the mouth. The chickpea patty was freshly made adding to the taste. Mayo was quite well balanced. Overall, felt simple but all the ingredients blended in well and the falafel felt just perfect. One small suggestion though. How about adding a half portion at Rs. 125? Feels light on the pocket and is quite filling for someone like me :) I guess I will be back sometime soon to try out other options in their menu. Having went there after hogging some delicious gelato elsewhere we couldn't really try out much today. All the the best to the guys running the show. It looks like a bold new attempt that depicts your hard work! I also appreciate the fact that neither the wrapping around the food nor the take away bag nor anything else had any plastic, keep it up! (go green). PS: we eventually had to opt for a takeaway for one portion as we couldn't eat it all there."

Pleasantly surprised by the decor ( if you could call it that) and very impressed by the effort considering its a food truck!!!. Had a cold sandwich ( egg, potato and chicken) and my husband had the veg falafel. Both were yummy and very very easy on the pocket . Coffee was decent enough considering it was served from a packet. Ended up with a saffron and rose water ice cream with a generous garnish of pistachios. All in all, a lovely experience; definitely to be repeated. Go if you love sandwiches and enjoy an easy vibe. The cons - sandwich is huuuuge ;) They should get a nice coffee machine ( if Persian cuisine permits them to ;) ) Shout Out to the owner who went out of his way to make us feel comfortable."

88-99,88,99,Legendary,"20 Reviews , 6 Followers",Sanjay Krishnaswami,5,"A true test for a really great eating joint is when it draws you back like a magnet. Boy! and did Soffreh draw us back. To begin with, I am a real big connoisseur of authentic Persian food and I have been ruing the lack of a single authentic Persian restaurant in Hyderabad ever since I moved here. I keep scouring Zomato regularly for anything that might seem to be authentic Persian and a few weeks back when I came upon Soffreh, I decided to give it a try. At that time they were located at a different spot. The sandwich was so good that I had to return back next week. Only the location had changed and it is now better. The food truck is parked by the side of a building and with the lights and seats the owners have created a beautiful ambiance that you can actually enjoy your evening of eating out. Coming to the main attraction the food - I tried the Koobideh Sandwich on both occasions and also the Cutty Murgh on the second. The Koobideh is my preferred choice. I have never come across a lamb patty so tender and juicy, that it just melts in your mouth. They bake their own bread and that tells in the quality of the sandwich. It is the softest, most flavorful bread you would have had ever. I have just found my favorite dish in all of Hyderabad and I will be back again and again to taste the Koobideh Sandwich. This one is a true winner!"

But when the food arrived I couldn't resist myself gorging on half a portion of the sandwich The quantity is humungous and very apt for the price. The food , my gosh the bread , absolutely exquisite.
