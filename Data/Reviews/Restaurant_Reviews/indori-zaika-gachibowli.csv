The combo looked great as it had Samosa,Poha and Jalebi.Jalebi was good but there was hardly any taste in Samosa and it was over fried. Poha was also going good till I found a small stone in it. Not worth your money!!!Order from someplace else..."

99-7,99,7,Poor,"35 Reviews , 28 Followers",Donnie (Anupam),1,"Guys, I know you are carrying a brand called Indore. You are abusing the brand 'indore' by delivering awfully cooked food. Your ' Sev tamarar' is nothing but tomato puree served with Sev. Poha do you even know how much salt you should add. Sabudana khichdi is too bland, I think even a new cook can't spoil this dish. Rotis are too bad, bhai khana jala rahe ho ya bana rahe ho. Sabudana wada, I think you should go eat sabudana wada pav to understand how a sabudana vada tastes. I dislike Golis sabudana vada pav but even those taste better. Have you ever had samosas in Indore? Go try it, there is firework of spices when you eat that samosa. I mean hands down, nobody can spoil food like you folks."

Loved the puri bhaji combo...again got 4 jalebis and 4 puri...will definitely order again
99-9,99,9,Poor,"2 Reviews , 2 Followers",Pushpendra Yadav,2,"Definitely not Indori Taste. Samosa is not Indori. Sabudana khichdi is half cooked and way far from real Indori Taste. Very much disappointed. Please don't say ""we are working on this and shall improve"". cause, I have seen your comments before and you didn't improve. :("
99-10,99,10,Poor,"3 Reviews , 14 Followers",Shruti Patel,2,Finally found poha and sabudana in Hyderabad...poha is very nice but sabudana wada and khichdi was too salty and they don’t provide any chutney or dahi with it...i guess indori zaika should start providing chutney or dahi with sabudana khichdi and sabudana wada

99-12,99,12,Very Good,"90 Reviews , 111 Followers",Ram Chandra,4,After trying poha from almost five places in hyd I feel this is the best place to have your breakfast if you are looking for poha and jelabi both are highly recommended and even tried their thali which was also surprisingly very tasty if I compare then this thali is much tastier and cheaper compared to Rajdhani's thali.

99-17,99,17,Average,"17 Reviews , 10 Followers",Vandana Nagdev,3,"Ordered two different poha combos, one with samosa and jalebi. Other with sabudana khichdi and gulab jamun. Also ordered paneer and alu paratha. Unfortunately sabudana went out of stock which i was really eager to have. Poha and jalebi were best among the things ordered. Poha is a must try! Parathas were very disappointing, less stuffing more aata."
99-18,99,18,Poor,"1 Review , 1 Follower",Soumya Sukul,1,The food was stinking like it was old and has gone bad. Also there was so much oil in the food. Sabudana khichdi was floating in oil. Very bad experience
99-19,99,19,Poor,"3 Reviews , 2 Followers",Anshi,2,"Ordered the Jalebi and poha via swiggy, jalebis tasted like they were fried in oil used for frying pakodas or bhajiya.(Why would you do that to a jalebi? ) Poha was okay."

99-53,99,53,Poor,"122 Reviews , 227 Followers",Praneetha Dundigalla,1,Ordered the north Indian veg Thali. The food lacked taste and I would say inedible. The so called dal was not dal but just water with little tomatoes. quality of rice was horrible. Roti's were not cooked well. The paneer rather tastes like a eraser. Food was quite cold too. Was hoping to have a proper North Indian Thali but this was too disappointing.
99-54,99,54,Average,11 Reviews,Jagrati Khandelwal,3,it's better if you provide curd or buttermilk in a disposable container.
99-55,99,55,Average,"42 Reviews , 246 Followers",Sujit,3,"A small take away joint with very limited seating options. Had a take away from this joint. The famed and a specialty of Indore sabudana khichadi and sev tamatar sabji... And Samosa-chatni..... Samosa and chatni were just good.. But sabudana khichadi lacked that Indoriness...I found it very ordinary... And my sister was fuming..... And Sev tamatar was really disappointing,I mean tamatar were very acidic,sev was smelling like it was bit stale and I don’t know which oil they use. I have seen good reviews about their Poha,I think will try it sometime."

99-68,99,68,Very Good,"134 Reviews , 916 Followers",Suresh Neralla,4,"Location spot on as in Google maps, lane behind Suraj Bar & Restaurant. Four-wheeler parking can be an issue at times. Don't expect fancy things here, it's a small food joint catering mostly to parcels and few small benches to sit beside the shop and have a quick bite. When entering saw a pile of samosas deep frying in a huge tawa, once they are out of oil bath tub gulped a couple of them with a pinch of sweet chutney & green chutney- superb taste, one among the best. Panipuri - crispy Puri, soft alu stuffing, moderately spicy & tangy paani - very good Indori Poha - soft & mildly sweet Poha topped with sev, chopped onion,some masala powder with a pinch of lemon juice - awesome though I can't vouch the indori part of it. Sabudana vada - crispy outside and soft inside & tasted best with tamatar&dhaniya chutney. They serve verity of Parathas and some interesting curries, many be in next visit. Service is super fast. Pricing - very reasonable. Only suggestion - socpe for improvement of hygiene levels."

99-72,99,72,Poor,"275 Reviews , 4106 Followers",Abhilash Pradhan (AbTheFoodie),2,"Update : Consistently bad and cold food , didn't expect this Update: I have been regularly ordering poha from here and yesterday thought of trying Jalebi's. But it was a terrible decision. Got 6 tiny cold rock hard Jalebis which I had no option but to throw away. Order poha without any thoughts but never Jalebis. Found this outlet while scrolling on the delivery app platforms and on a whim ordered an Indori Poha . Priced at 35 its a good snacking option with a decent potion size . You get the namkeen and onions extra which you need to sprinkle on the poha before eating to give it an indori feel . The taste was very good and i'm definitely ordering again.
