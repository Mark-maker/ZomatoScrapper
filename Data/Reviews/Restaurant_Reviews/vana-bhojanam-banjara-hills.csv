Served with the welcome drink which was tasing good and it was looking concentrated but I loved the taste of it. Started it with the vada and vada is one of my favorite thing on Earth that I had almost all which was served to me and there was another one like bajji which I dint try and still couldn't figure out what bajji it was and I dint try it as the outer covering was too oily and thought not to waste them. Later we ordered for starters so we had chilli paneer which was the best among the starters and it was spicy and tasty too and the paneer were soft.Next veg starter was baby corn which was also tasty and crispy and good to go for another round of this.Later came the aloo 65 which was also tasted like chilli paneer and it was well cooked.Then comes the non-veg starters where we were served with fish fry which was a consistently fried.The other starters were chicken and prawns and if you scroll down to photos you can figure out that both looks he same which had the outer coating and since the marination was the same even they tasted the same. Coming to the ugadi special thali,we had the star of the day ugadi pachadi which was sweet,bitter one which had he taste of green mango,one bajji,rice,chappati,pulihora,poornam boralu,papad,payasam,curd and beerkaya pachadi.The thali was heavy kinda that I could finish the whole thing.Taste was okay. Talking about the ambiance,this place have a heritage look and we have sitting arrangement both inside and outside and we choose the inside one as we went there with a big gang and so it is easy to arrange seats inside for us.Outdoor sitting is a retro one with pictures of old telugu actors and paintings and wall art was a great one.Loved the old motorcycles kept for display there and good for a great photoshoot if you are looking for a retro theme."

The outside seating setup is really good, but because of the heat, we decided to seat inside. The staff was well behaved and the ambience was OK. Coming to food, we started off with Vada and Betel leaf Fry with Chutney. The Vada was really good. Then went for Aloo 65. It was medium spicy and tasted OK. The welcome drink was average. Paneer item and the other veg starters were above average. The best thing about the place is their Thali. Lot of variety and ample portions. Really loved the Thali as the taste was very good. This is the must try thing at this place. Definitely visiting this place again."

Honestly this cuisine have never been my preference but Vana Bhojanam could lure me here again with their taste. There were few starters which really stood out like Chilly Garelu(it was kinda like vada but with tastiest chutney), Tamalapaku Bajji(Paan was the leaf which was used), aalo vapudu etc, But the highlight of the lunch was the Thali. The main attraction here is Thali which is only 199/- and everything in it was too good especially the Pachadi and Payasam. It's a really pocket friendly place with good food, apart from the Ugadi Lunch also, the Thalis served on daily basis seems good. Service: The staff is really polite and help you choose if you are not aware of Andhra food."

Adorned with portraits of yester year stars, some vintage two wheelers in a garden like seating, the open area felt quite cool inspite of the hot sun! A big graffiti on one of the walls is the USP of this outdoor seating section. Coming to the food, I tried Tamalapaaku Bajji (Betel Leaf Pakore) for the first time ever and quite liked it. Tried a variety of starters and liked all of them, especially the chutney accompaniments in traditional Andhra style! Main course was a thali affair with sambhar, rasam, vepudu, Payasam, Ugadi Pachadi and stuff..the different flavors we're quite enticing on the palate.

Ambience: Decent look in the lawn area with some antique hangings nd tried to give an old village style look which was impressive and I need to mention about the seating where they used the base of sewing machine which is modified as a table which was looking good but I did not like it because the top of the table was wobbling. There was a cruetset of chutneys on table which were not cleaned and lots of dust on them. Taste: Worst food.. all items are cold except Rice and are either bland or spicy.Aloo curry had was very sour because may the chef might used lots of tomatoes in it....and Dal and sambar were ok...and rasam was taste less and chutney was too spicy...the flavoured rice that they served was lemon rice which again has lots of groundnuts and tempering in it..ordered fish fry which was smelly and had lots of bone and portion size was too small for the price that they took.. Service: Had to wait for 15min for someone to come and take order and once I ordered than they quickly brought the thali but again I had to wait or call them for the second serving of rice...untill and unless you call them and ask they will not get any food which I felt is not a proper service. Money: The thali was about ‚Çπ130 which is a decent price and ‚Çπ140 for the fish fry which is very high for the quantity that they gave. OVERALL EXPERIENCE: 2.5/5

First impressions as we entered - renovation work with lot of hammering sound, which was not so welcoming and a lady holding broom and staring at us... Anyways, we had come to eat and didn‚Äôt waist a minute. We entered and ordered the specials straight away as the menu fell short of options. We ordered chicken fry(made with curry leaves) for starters, Roti and chicken curry and then Nilgiri mutton biryani, which were the only options available, except for meals. Since there were hardly any guests even at 1:30pm, we were hoping our food would arrive quick. Sadly, our order took longer than expected and there were more flies than people in what appeared to be dark and shady place. So finally we changed tables and shifted to a decent looking table hoping the food would arrive any moment. After a long pause the chicken fry was served, it was not up to my expectations - as there were too many pieces prepared with what appears to be chicken skin. Then roti and chicken curry arrived which was very basic and finally the biryani arrived straight from the Nilgiris. Except for the plain white rice, nothing else was warm and the mutton pieces were cold as ice. That was definitely not what I had expected. We couldn‚Äôt bear any longer. We gave our feedback to the staff/management hoping they would at least make things better for future customers. Cheers!"

U may like NV as non veg cooked any style is always liked by NV lovers....#patheticexperience....Hope it inc@reases the quality by hearing some of the honest reviews and feedback...Thought of coming up with a theme eatery is the only plus....."

Cousins ordered biryani(chicken fry piece), they said it was not worth the money and are very disappointed. Also mutton keema was way too salty. Good one for vegetarian thali. Else not worth it."

87-281,87,281,Poor,"163 Reviews , 704 Followers",Karthik Reddy Bandi,2,"Me along with my family went to Vana Bhojanam for lunch on Sunday. I wanted my family especially my wife to enjoy Telugu hospitality and cuisine. We ordered for Andhra meals, Karvepaku Kodi and Mutton Fry. We wanted to order for Karvepaku Prawns and fish fry but were told that they were not available. It is criminal to not serve some dishes on what is a small menu especially on a Sunday! The restaurant was empty when we came in at 12:30 pm. It was almost half full during our meal. Ambiance ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî Initial impressions were that the place was small and ordinary and the pricing justifies that. The outdoor seating tries to give that feeling of the woods but I still don‚Äôt get how those old scrap vehicles used for decor fit within the concept. It instead uses up space and doesn‚Äôt make sense. Andhra Meals: ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî The meals has Rice served along with Dal, Sambar, Rasam, Aloo Fry, Okra Curry and Curd. We were not served flavoured rice. It was only at the end of the meal when we asked about it that we had the dish served. We had to wait for more than 20 minutes for the meals to be served after the starters. We were told that the rice was not yet ready and this was at 1:15 :-O Once the food was finally served, The rice was lukewarm and so were all the dishes that were served alongside. We asked for ghee and the guy took atleast 10 mins to bring it to the table. My bad experience with their service did not just end there. I was served two cups of rasam instead of sambar and the waiter spent another 10 minutes replacing it. During our meal we had to progressively wait for each of the refill of dal, sambar, rasam or vegetable fry. I could not entirely blame the waiter. They were serving all the refills by replacing the finished cups of dal etc with the new cups. This doesn‚Äôt make sense. Usually the servers carry each of the dish - Dal/sambar etc in a huge tumbler and pour generously when asked for a refill. Their concept of serving itself did not seem practical. It makes diners wait for a quantity that it not a whole lot. It felt cheap and ruined the experience. It just doesn‚Äôt feel right waiting with our hands drying in anticipation of a refill. That killed the experience. The food was sub-par. The Dal tasted good. It was thick and comforting. It went great with the ghee. The sambar was okay. It did not have the standing out flavour of the vegetables or the dal. Serving Aloo as the vegetable fry felt shocking. I never had Aloo fry as the only veggie fry in an Andhra meal. The rasam did not feel like a flavour bomb. The Okra curry tasted yuck. It was sour and we just could not finish a mouthful of it. Some of the fryums were soggy. The feel of an Andhra meal was missing. Hot rice served with piping hot curries with a smooth service is the least I expect from a restaurant serving meals. The only saving grace of an otherwise horrible experience was the Karvepaku kodi and Mutton Fry. Karvepaku Kodi and Mutton Fry ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî Both the dishes tasted absolute yum. The chicken was well marinated and doubly fried to give that yummy succulence and flavour. The mutton fry had perfectly cooked mutton and crispy bits of mutton at the end providing some lovely texture. These were the saving grace of an otherwise horrible experience. But again, we came to the restaurant for the meals and the experience was easily amongst my worst. To make matters worse, the owner thrashed one of their servers when the table in front of us complained! It felt like we were in a hostile environment. Even after the meal, we were incorrectly billed 3 times at the end despite us telling what we ordered. I would go with 2 out of 5 for Vana Bhojanam. The service was poor, cheap and shoddy. The only saving grace was their non-veg starters."

You'll get shadab take away biryani at a similar price. But this place is good for meals, which does not include chapatis but it'll cost you 20 bucks. Service is good and so is the ambience."

They're extremely good when it comes to south Indian dishes, especially starters. We had Kodi vepudu - Stir fried south Indian style chicken with curry leaves, teen chillies and hint of pepper. Extremely tasty and very well spiced. Fish fry - Not very good, average. This was deep fried and the fish was fresh. Mutton fry - Real good home taste. Succulent pieces of mutton. Very delicate and perfectly marinated. Bhindi fry - This was deep fry bhindi with besan. Good option for vegetarians. For main course we had Thali which had a lot of items. Sambar - Very good and a rich taste. Tomato aloo curry - Very tasty, well spiced. Pappy - I'm a huge fan of Dal, so this can be a little based. Daal was thick and flavoursome. Will go really well with rice. They also had a lot of other items I did not try in their thali. And here's the surprise. They serve biriyani in Thali! Biryani that is real good, subtle and had rightly flavored neat/ Chicken. My friend had suggested me to try the biriyani with ghee. And Oh God that was heaven on earth. In the curries I had tried Mutton curry. I am a huge fan of south Indian non veg curries. Nice , spicy and tangy. For desserts we had Gulab Jamun which was decent, could have been softer. And another dessert local to Andhra/ Telangana. It was puran Poli stuffing ( Daal and jaggery) inside wada batter which was fried. I tasted it. It was good and not very sweet. On the whole, for people who want to have a satisfactory meal taste wise and quantity wise at a rather cheap price, this is a go to."

This place is located right where the old door was located. When it comes to place its a small cute little place with some inside as well as outdoor seating with an awesome painting on wall üòú. The seating is quite spacious and suitable for family visits too. Service is not an issue too as we were attended and served promptly. We weren't kept waiting any time during our meal and the owner himself was with us during our good time spent here. The best part of the place i.e food is something you should look at this place. Tried their awesome starters like liver fry, mutton fry, prawns iguru, spl karivepaku kodi and their meals Thali.. Though everything was good liver and karivepaku kodi were my favorites from the lot... But the best part of this place came at the end i.e their biryani. Hand down the best biryani I had in any south Indian restaurant... Punchy flavors with aromatic rice is what all you need in biryani. For deserts had their poornam boorelu which was like a bhajiya filled with something like puran(jaggery made) we used to have in puran puri... Pour some ghee in it before taking the bite and there you go.. One of the richest desert you can have üëç Overall this place is surely a great option for people looking around for some meals and biryani in Banjara hills area thegastrodiaries.wordpress.com"

Full meals at just Rs. 130 and any side dish like chicken fry is just for Rs. 90!! For the quality of food in the plate, you won't need any side dish unless you want to have some very good chicken curry or fry or fish fry. I am curious to taste their menu and tried chicken curry portion and fish fry. Both are amazing in taste and portion size. A real value for money and clear differentiator on Road No:2, Banjara Hills, in terms of experience. Well done..."

Newbie in town but serving some of the amazing and pocket friendly Andhra thali's. Visited this place few days back for dinner with my gang as heard a lot about this place by many foodies. Ambiance is quite decent and pricing too. Have tried all their dishes but the üåü one needs to be mentioned earlier which was Vanabhojanam special karivepaku Kodi, Mutton liver fry & Poornam Boorelu. Starters: Started with karivepaku Kodi which I already decaled as a star was great and must try. Fish fry was decent as I am not a fish lover but as told by my friends it was good. Mutton fry was nice, pieces were really tender and perfect spicy level, Prawns iguru was great too but the only issue is the pieces should have been little bigger but taste wise it was great. Main Course: We tried their amazing thali which is the focus point on this place, sambhar & pappu were really good. Rasam was decent so as the bhindi (lady finger) fry. Chicken biryani was decent and little different which we usually had in other outlets. Dessert: Gulab jamun was OK, it was little hard whereas it should be soft. Another was üåü i.e. Poornam Boorelu which I had for the first time. I had it with ghee and alone as well but it was much better then ghee on the top. Simply loved this dish at this place. A Must try but with ghee. Overall we had an amazing time at this place and will recommend to all to visit this place if you are Andhra style food lover. This place is good for non vegetarians because this place is not having much items in veg. Pocket friendly place and total value for üí∞. Will love to visit again for their thali's and Poornam Boorelu."
87-290,87,290,Excellent,"132 Reviews , 1812 Followers",Meraj Ahmed,4,"This place gives a homely feeling. They tried to match the name of their place 'Vana' which means forest. The place looks beautiful, it is spacious and open. Decorated with beautiful bulbs, artificial leaves and bamboo sticks which gives a foresty look. It's rare for people to find good food at lower prices in areas lie Jubilee Hills and Banjara hills.. Vanabhojanam is now the option. Simple Menu | Affordable pricing. Started off with vanaBhojanam specials Karivepaku Kodi. Fine pieces of boneless chicken fried with a coating of curry leaf spiced flavours. For me this was the Star of all the starters I had at this place. Really loved the Karivepaku flavour and the meat was too soft to eat. Served fresh and hot. Firsh Fry, they use a fish which is regionally known as ""Katla"". I love fish starters, but I did not have too much of this because I dont feel like wasting my time on pulling out the bones from the fish. Tasted a bit of it and I could realize it was good and perfectly marinated. Bhindi fry starter was good and crispy. Prawns Iguru, Andhra style tiny prawns. This was prepared good but the taste was salty due to the prawns being small in size. As prawns were small, the taste was more of the coating. Mutton Fry, Loved this one. Succulent pieces of mutton and made south indian style. It was higher on the spicier side. Mutton liver fry was something I never had outside my home. This had the same taste what my mum prepares at home. The Non veg thali has so much to offer. I forgot all the names of thali contents. I tried everything from the thali and taste was really good. Mutton and Chicken Gravies were prepared very well. Biryanis, tasted both chicken, Mutton and chicken fried Biryani. These were great in taste. Desserts: Gulab Jamun and Poornam Boorelu. Poornam boorelu was really went well with the Ghee that they offered on table. Also had that ghee with Biryani and biryani became more flavorful. Overall, left the place with great satisfaction. Shared a few feedback with owner Mr. Reddy and he assured that will be taken care of."

87-292,87,292,Excellent,"176 Reviews , 921 Followers",Purbita Chakraborty,4,"Affordable South Indian Eatery in the plush locality of banjara hills needs some applause, to begin with! Ambience: resembles that of a highway South Indian Dhaba. Minimalistic and open air. Location: the left lane adjacent to ice-creamery that is situated in rd num 2 banjara hills (kbr park road) Food price: Very Economical Food: The menu is biased towards non vegetarians and boy do I love that! Appetizers: there are a lot of fried items. Karivepaku kodi: this was a crispy fried boneless chicken item. The best out of the lot! Crispy, oil-free and tasty. MUST TRY Mutton fry: comes garnished with cashews on top and is succulent, soft and very spicy. MUST TRY if you can handle the spice. Fish fry: this is with bone and is okay-ish to taste. The masala seemed less to taste. Prawn fry or prawn iguru: this was crispy as well but not as good as the chicken. Mains: MUST TRY Non veg thali: the mutton and chicken curry that comes in the thali is delicious. Bhindi fry is good as well. It is batter fried and crispy. The rest pf the bowls had sambar, daal, rasam, mint and coriander rice, etc. Fresh hot rice is served on the table with the thali. There is also a chutney on the side and a bowl of curd. Biryani: MUST TRY Both mutton and chicken biryani was extremely delicious and home-like with moderate amount of masala and spice level. Overall satisfaction: This place will give you much more than the price you pay for the food. Note: They also have pachhadis, podis and ghee placed on the table for you to enjoy with the thalis!

Finally got a chance to visit this place and the location of this restaurant is really good and easy to find which in itself will ease the customers to dine in without spending a lot of time finding the location. The first impression it gives is of the old style house or dhaba with decent seating arrangement keeping it neat and clean. It has both AC and Non-AC sections. A really nice place for family and friends. It was really great how the management helped us in serving food and recommending there best dishes so that we don‚Äôt miss the prime dishes of this place. Initially for starters we had Karivepaku Kodi which is deep fried crispy boneless chicken at its best. Later on Fish Fry and Shrimp fry were served which were decent in taste but I loved Karivepaku Kodi. After the round of starters we ordered Thali, Mutton Fry, Mutton Curry, Chicken curry, Mutton Biryani and Chicken Biryani. The Mutton Fry was packed with Masalas which would be amazing if served with Rotis. The Mutton Biryani was cooked with perfection keeping the right quantity of Masala which resulted in great taste. Finally I had the best part of the menu in my opinion was it‚Äôs Mutton Liver Fry which was made with great taste frying to its required tenderness with right quantity of masala. Will surely visit this place again for Mutton Liver Fry. Finally had Poornam Boorelu and Gulab Jamun which was a perfect end to the meal."

The interior is setup with all the antiques and wall paintings. The place is little bit small but the interior is beautiful. I was invited for tasting session by the Management. In starters, we had Special Karivepaku Kodi which is crispy fried boneless chicken with curry leaves. The next one was Fish Fry, they served Katla fish. Then Vanabhojanam Special Karivepaku Royallu which is crispy fried shrimps with curry leaves. Then crispy Okra fry which is fried ladyfingers. The last in the starters was Mutton fry. The fried chicken and mutton are must try dishes here. Then we tried Special Andhra Thali, all the things was good and it had the authentic Andhra taste. I liked the Sambar and Dal. Then we also tried Chicken Biryani and Mutton Biryani. Despite being the Andhra restaurant, they served authentic Hyderabadi Biryani. Then in the last we had Deserts, which include Poornam Boorelu and Gulab Jamun. The Poornam Boorelu is the Andhra dessert which is similar to the Pooran Poli. comparestudio.com"

Located in the lane next to icecreamery, where Old Door was previously located. Decent interiors for a small area and lit up nicely. There are a few antiques like scooter, which were used in some of the Telugu films, the table top over a sewing machine.... The menu is simple and it delivers. Thali being it's pro, and it's reasonably priced at 130/- For the starters we had, Vanabhojanam special karivepaku chicken- am in love with this dish, probably best of the lot. It's crispy, it's spicy, a typical Andhra snack I would say. Rightly balanced too. Add a a dash of lemon and wow Vanabhojanam special karivepaku royyalu - all the spices were right and nice, I would have enjoyed it better, if the salt took a low note. Hitches do happen in the initial days, totally understandable. Mutton fry- if you are someone who loves spicy food, then this is for you. Fish fry- was good but the bones did tricky Thali is what this place is all about - proper Telugu food on a plate. There's a Roti pachadi to start with, I loved the coriander mint flavoured rice, okra fry needed salt, there's aloo curry, pappu, Sambhar, rasam and curd. All tasted pretty much like home cooked food. Also the Biryanis here are pretty good. For Desserts, Poornam boorelu- now this needs special mention, dip or dunk it with ghee and you are on cloud 9. Loved it totally. Gulab jamun- was okayish Whenever I need a quick meal or thali am gonna back üëß"
