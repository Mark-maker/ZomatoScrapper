They offered me to try the Odiya thali and I agreed. The food was freshly prepared , and tastewise up to the mark. We ordered chilli chicken , which was way too spicy for my threshold. The host was humble and he promised to serve a Bengali thali pretty soon. So looking forward to that. Overall , a neat experience. Give it a shot guys"

98-6,98,6,Very Good,"187 Reviews , 1437 Followers",Karthik Kodumuru,4,"------- Small Place, Great Food, Low Price -------- I found this gem when I was searching for dinner place at around 12 PM. Ambience looks cool surrounded by plants with dim lights. You feel pleasant for the atmosphere created inside. I was so hungry and didn't go through the menu much, had Jeera Rice with Dal Tadka, I can say one of the best. Quantity is quite sufficient for a person. It tasted so good, it matched my taste buds. Loved the taste. Pretty satsified with the pricing. Looking forward to try more. If you are around Ayyappa Society and you are looking for a pocket friendly meal, head over to this place. Thumbs Up."

Mushroom Rice Bowl is very pocket-friendly and delicious - good to have on days when I don't want to eat much The ambience is simple and pleasing and service is good. Can't ask for more."

But I recommend their egg chicken Mughlai paratha which comes with an odia style aalu(potatoes) masala that complements it so well. A must recommend friends.

98-32,98,32,Poor,"2 Reviews , 12 Followers",Narayan,1,Worst restaurant..first of all they serve the same dishes as Bengali oriya and Andhra cuisine and claim that they are authentic for all the three cuisines. Secondly they have nothing called courtesy as well. We ordered pappu avakaya annam and they served some rice with avakaya without pappu(dal). Worst part was they didn't even bother to say sorry or give a discount as a small token of apology. Also they have a complete closed kitchen so can't see how clean it is inside.Don't go to this place unless you want to be cheated.

98-91,98,91,Legendary,"115 Reviews , 4689 Followers",Saurav Mishra,5,"Latest update: Bengali Food Festival. Went with my brother and friends to try their Bengali dishes. Mughlai Paratha: it was soft, crunchy and totally stuffed with chicken and egg. It tasted awesome. Chicken Biryani: authentic Bengali biryani having the mandatory chicken, egg and potato with the flavoured Dum rice. Tasty and delicious. Hot and sour soup: it was perfect, having the right amount of chicken pieces, the taste, everything was just balanced perfectly. Laal Maas: this one dish I'm disappointed, I packed it for my dinner. It had really very small pieces, it contained 4 boneless small pieces and 4 bones. The taste and look lacked the authenticity of the laal Maas. It needs some improvement. I was invited for a tasting session of the restaurant's menu. The ambiance is really very nicely done, with trees n plants, a hanging cycle which resembles with the small eateries by the road side on the highway in Orissa. The restaurant deals with odia, Bengali and south India cuisines. LUNCH: I was given a Veg Thali, Mutton Curry {mati handi mansa} and Chicken Curry. The quantity of food is too good, enough to satiate an empty stomach to breaking point. Mati Handi Mansa, its a specialty of odia cuisine where the mutton is slowly cooked in an earthen pot. The Chicken Curry was delicious. Gulab Jamun for dessert was superb, freshly made hot, soft and juicy. EVENING SNACKS: Chicken rolls and Chicken Pakoda. Now the rolls size was ok but the stuffing didn't had enough chicken in it. The chicken Pakoda quantity was good but it lacked the taste n crispiness in it. My suggestion would be to increase the quantity of chicken in the rolls, there should be a piece in each bite. OVERALL: It's a value for money place, which provides delicious home styled food and doesn't burn a hole in your pocket. MUST TRY: Mati Handi Mansa, Chicken Curry, Aloo Bharta."
