96-43,96,43,Very Good,"73 Reviews , 158 Followers",Sai Santhosh Rayeli,4,This is one of the most underrated restaurant.They serve great food and their proportions were huge.We ordered Shanghai rolls and veg sticks both were phenomenal.Veg sticks might probably be one of the best starters i ever had.It.was filled with cashews and it was perfectly perfectly crisp.They even have unique varities of biryanis to choose from.I will definitely revisit this place nd also refer one to visit this place.

96-46,96,46,Poor,"5 Reviews , 192 Followers",Alvin Viswas,1,I gave this restaurant a second try after a very horrible first experience which ended in red eyes and watery noses on how spicy the food was. Spicy food is good and trust me on it because that's how I've been brought up.But spicy is good only up to a point. This restaurant crosses all the desired limitations when it comes to food.its as if they forgot to put in salt and added chillies thrice.Once was fine but I walked out twice with tears in my eyes. To add to all this is the careless service and dirty floors and the condition of the crockery. All of this adds up to a place I would never suggest anyone to visit unless they are my enemies.
96-47,96,47,Very Good,"12 Reviews , 45 Followers",Joyeeta Dey,4,Had lovely lunch and dinner here. Ambience is very good and food is also good. Price is reasonable too. Moghlai chinese all dishes are tasty as expected.
96-48,96,48,Average,"14 Reviews , 3 Followers",Dharani Reddy,2,Coming to the veg part curries better don't try and coming to the nonveg starters i would rate it at 3.5 and curries were good (3.5) and the biryani tastes different every time I try there.

96-53,96,53,Poor,"1 Review , 2 Followers",Krishna Mohan,1,"Worst, Shit. I got couple of cockroach kids in chicken biryani. Dont ever dare to have lunch or dinner. Even though staff and management is good. Worst experience. Just after coming home my friend vomited. Warning:Dont prefer abinand grand.

96-58,96,58,Poor,"10 Reviews , 581 Followers",Chetan Bhawani,1,"Won't say much about anything else although would have, as a single mistake proved to be a big one for us. Vegetarians and ordered veg food with fried rice. Now the gravy that came along for finished and we asked for more. The one that came next tasted different and we asked why. To our shock the first one was the non veg gravy. Never going to eat there again."

96-60,96,60,Average,"5 Reviews , 26 Followers",Balaji Kumar,2,Food was not that good especially we has a butter chicken which was full of colour and taste was not up to the mark. Biryani was full of masala and spicy. Ambience was good . Service has to be improved a lot.
96-61,96,61,Poor,"8 Reviews , 1 Follower",Bharath Reddy,1,Recently I went here along with my colleagues for lunch at around 3:30 pm.. Ambience is good.. Staff behaviour could be better.. Most important aspect food.. Very average food quality.. We have ordered a chicken dry advised by the Stewart.. Which was horrible..we thought It's okay.. It happens once in a while in any restaurant.. But we came to conclusion once we had the Biryani... Biryani here is pathetic.. That's my opinion.

96-63,96,63,Poor,5 Reviews,Krishna Kireeti,1,"Taste not really good..not satisfied with quality. Providing much quantity but not maintaining taste. Since it is new. ,still have a chance to improve taste and reputation"
96-64,96,64,Excellent,"1 Review , 1 Follower",Raji Goel,4,This is one of the finest restaurant's in hyderabad. I have been to Abhinand Grand like four to five times in the past two months. Every time I go I am surprised with the food they serve. Its more and more delicious and oustanding. The starters are a highlight here and also not to forget the curries with Roti's.I have become a fan of the cook. I dont know who he is but there is magic in his hands. Overall its a refreshment to the tongue and its finger licking good.Coming to the ambience after a busy day to day life we can spend some time looking at the fishes and relax .Last week I went with my family and they have given a separate room kind of thing which separates us from the public and we can have a quality time with our family and kids even if we are in the restaurant. Overall I would give a 4.5 rating and I would suggest everyone to try this atleast once.Trust me if you try it you will not leave it. Food : 4.5 Ambience : 4 Staff Behaviour : 4.5 Thanks & Regards Raji

Getting on to food we ordered the the starters both veg and non veg tasted wonderful and awesome., extremely finger licking delicious . Many dishes were mouth watering, i still remember the chicken biryani one of the best I've had in Hyderabad. It was simply (Good- service+food+ambience)=perfect!!.

96-72,96,72,Very Good,"18 Reviews , 11 Followers",Chandra Mouli Pingali,4,"The veg biryani is amazing. Tomato soup and starters are good. The naans and curries are pretty good as well. Being a new place, I would say their main USP is the price and taste. Their service could be a little better though!"
96-73,96,73,Good,"2 Reviews , 4 Followers",Manas Chafekar,3,"Decent price. Great garlic chicken tikka. Good veg and non veg dishes. Good ambiance. Poor service, but you can look at the fishes in the aquarium for passing time. Pallet test: Decent veggie tasting dishes, explosively spicy starters,good and clean meat textures Overall: 3.3 out of 5.0"
