I clearly mentioned that I would like to pay some extra money so that I can get Mutton biryani, but th4y refuse and clearly stated that they will send only chicken fried rice instead and they can't make any changes to it. It was pathetic and totally disappointed with this service. the food went straight to garbage as I'm allergic to ajinomoto that they add in fried rice. I would want you to sort these kind of services and add anything to compensate the loss."
