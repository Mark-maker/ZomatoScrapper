83-3,83,3,Poor,"6 Reviews , 1 Follower",Gautam,2,Chicken tikka burger is their best!! But very unfortunately they always give ketchup which is out of expiry date. This I believe is a very serious issue and I brought it to the notice of both Zomato customer care and the Snack hub as well. I wish to be taken very seriously and see that it doesn't repeat and our faith restored in you. I also took the ketchup sachets to the Snack Hub and they admitted to the mistake of theirs

So I go around places to try different pastries,so last weekend me and my friend went to have some chat near nallagandala fly over and after having some chat i wanted to have something sweet and I found out this place and gave it a try. Well the place was quite good. the price was also reasonable so, you can give it a try for sure."

96-46,96,46,Poor,"5 Reviews , 192 Followers",Alvin Viswas,1,I gave this restaurant a second try after a very horrible first experience which ended in red eyes and watery noses on how spicy the food was. Spicy food is good and trust me on it because that's how I've been brought up.But spicy is good only up to a point. This restaurant crosses all the desired limitations when it comes to food.its as if they forgot to put in salt and added chillies thrice.Once was fine but I walked out twice with tears in my eyes. To add to all this is the careless service and dirty floors and the condition of the crockery. All of this adds up to a place I would never suggest anyone to visit unless they are my enemies.

96-64,96,64,Excellent,"1 Review , 1 Follower",Raji Goel,4,This is one of the finest restaurant's in hyderabad. I have been to Abhinand Grand like four to five times in the past two months. Every time I go I am surprised with the food they serve. Its more and more delicious and oustanding. The starters are a highlight here and also not to forget the curries with Roti's.I have become a fan of the cook. I dont know who he is but there is magic in his hands. Overall its a refreshment to the tongue and its finger licking good.Coming to the ambience after a busy day to day life we can spend some time looking at the fishes and relax .Last week I went with my family and they have given a separate room kind of thing which separates us from the public and we can have a quality time with our family and kids even if we are in the restaurant. Overall I would give a 4.5 rating and I would suggest everyone to try this atleast once.Trust me if you try it you will not leave it. Food : 4.5 Ambience : 4 Staff Behaviour : 4.5 Thanks & Regards Raji

Secondly they have nothing called courtesy as well. We ordered pappu avakaya annam and they served some rice with avakaya without pappu(dal). Worst part was they didn't even bother to say sorry or give a discount as a small token of apology. Also they have a complete closed kitchen so can't see how clean it is inside.Don't go to this place unless you want to be cheated.

It had really very small pieces, it contained 4 boneless small pieces and 4 bones. The taste and look lacked the authenticity of the laal Maas. It needs some improvement. I was invited for a tasting session of the restaurant's menu. The ambiance is really very nicely done, with trees n plants, a hanging cycle which resembles with the small eateries by the road side on the highway in Orissa. The restaurant deals with odia, Bengali and south India cuisines. LUNCH: I was given a Veg Thali, Mutton Curry {mati handi mansa} and Chicken Curry. The quantity of food is too good, enough to satiate an empty stomach to breaking point. Mati Handi Mansa, its a specialty of odia cuisine where the mutton is slowly cooked in an earthen pot. The Chicken Curry was delicious. Gulab Jamun for dessert was superb, freshly made hot, soft and juicy. EVENING SNACKS: Chicken rolls and Chicken Pakoda. Now the rolls size was ok but the stuffing didn't had enough chicken in it. The chicken Pakoda quantity was good but it lacked the taste n crispiness in it. My suggestion would be to increase the quantity of chicken in the rolls, there should be a piece in each bite. OVERALL: It's a value for money place, which provides delicious home styled food and doesn't burn a hole in your pocket. MUST TRY: Mati Handi Mansa, Chicken Curry, Aloo Bharta."

Found this outlet while scrolling on the delivery app platforms and on a whim ordered an Indori Poha . Priced at 35 its a good snacking option with a decent potion size .

I clearly mentioned that I would like to pay some extra money so that I can get Mutton biryani, but th4y refuse and clearly stated that they will send only chicken fried rice instead and they can't make any changes to it. It was pathetic and totally disappointed with this service. the food went straight to garbage as I'm allergic to ajinomoto that they add in fried rice.

Served with the welcome drink which was tasing good and it was looking concentrated but I loved the taste of it. Started it with the vada and vada is one of my favorite thing on Earth that I had almost all which was served to me and there was another one like bajji which I dint try and still couldn't figure out what bajji it was and I dint try it as the outer covering was too oily and thought not to waste them. Later we ordered for starters so we had chilli paneer which was the best among the starters and it was spicy and tasty too and the paneer were soft.Next veg starter was baby corn which was also tasty and crispy and good to go for another round of this.Later came the aloo 65 which was also tasted like chilli paneer and it was well cooked.Then comes the non-veg starters where we were served with fish fry which was a consistently fried.The other starters were chicken and prawns and if you scroll down to photos you can figure out that both looks he same which had the outer coating and since the marination was the same even they tasted the same. Coming to the ugadi special thali,we had the star of the day ugadi pachadi which was sweet,bitter one which had he taste of green mango,one bajji,rice,chappati,pulihora,poornam boralu,papad,payasam,curd and beerkaya pachadi.The thali was heavy kinda that I could finish the whole thing.Taste was okay. Talking about the ambiance,this place have a heritage look and we have sitting arrangement both inside and outside and we choose the inside one as we went there with a big gang and so it is easy to arrange seats inside for us.Outdoor sitting is a retro one with pictures of old telugu actors and paintings and wall art was a great one.Loved the old motorcycles kept for display there and good for a great photoshoot if you are looking for a retro theme."

Coming to food, we started off with Vada and Betel leaf Fry with Chutney. The Vada was really good. Then went for Aloo 65. It was medium spicy and tasted OK. The welcome drink was average. Paneer item and the other veg starters were above average. The best thing about the place is their Thali. Lot of variety and ample portions. Really loved the Thali as the taste was very good.

Honestly this cuisine have never been my preference but Vana Bhojanam could lure me here again with their taste. There were few starters which really stood out like Chilly Garelu(it was kinda like vada but with tastiest chutney), Tamalapaku Bajji(Paan was the leaf which was used), aalo vapudu etc, But the highlight of the lunch was the Thali. The main attraction here is Thali which is only 199/- and everything in it was too good especially the Pachadi and Payasam. It's a really pocket friendly place with good food, apart from the Ugadi Lunch also, the Thalis served on daily basis seems good.

This place is tucked in a quiet lane in the busy Banjara Hills road and is easy to spot. The facade and indoor seating look like any normal bungalow but the outdoor seating blows your mind! Adorned with portraits of yester year stars, some vintage two wheelers in a garden like seating, the open area felt quite cool inspite of the hot sun! A big graffiti on one of the walls is the USP of this outdoor seating section. Coming to the food, I tried Tamalapaaku Bajji (Betel Leaf Pakore) for the first time ever and quite liked it. Tried a variety of starters and liked all of them, especially the chutney accompaniments in traditional Andhra style! Main course was a thali affair with sambhar, rasam, vepudu, Payasam, Ugadi Pachadi and stuff..the different flavors we're quite enticing on the palate.

There is nothing much done with the place just some chairs and tables inside and outdoor seating have some quirky vehicles and designs. The ugadi special thali was a huge one with almost 10 - 15 dishes, chapati and unlimited rice for just 199++, it was really a steal deal. The food was good along with a bunch of very polite staff.

Aloo 65 fry, chilly paneer and Kothimeera baby corn were the veg starters. Out of all these, I found the chilly paneer to be the best. We also ordered fish fry. The Ugadi Special lunch followed the starters. Served thali style, Indian chips with South Indian curries and drinks completed the course. For sweets, the semiya was very good to taste."

Non-veg thali was ok among which i liked the pappu more than any thing else served. Non-veg thali comes with chicken curry, mutton curry and royyalu(prawns) iguru(semi wet gravy), while mutton curry was good but had a lot of oil in it! Over all the savers from thali were prawns which was reasonable, mutton and pappu(dal)! Ambience wise... Its a decent try towards the rustic look, however could've been better!

87-268,87,268,Average,"31 Reviews , 56 Followers",Rohan Sagar,2,Excited to be here after reading so many positive reviews but unfortunately had the worst thali and fish fry... Ambience: Decent look in the lawn area with some antique hangings nd tried to give an old village style look which was impressive and I need to mention about the seating where they used the base of sewing machine which is modified as a table which was looking good but I did not like it because the top of the table was wobbling. There was a cruetset of chutneys on table which were not cleaned and lots of dust on them. Taste: Worst food.. all items are cold except Rice and are either bland or spicy.Aloo curry had was very sour because may the chef might used lots of tomatoes in it....and Dal and sambar were ok...and rasam was taste less and chutney was too spicy...the flavoured rice that they served was lemon rice which again has lots of groundnuts and tempering in it..ordered fish fry which was smelly and had lots of bone and portion size was too small for the price that they took.. Service: Had to wait for 15min for someone to come and take order and once I ordered than they quickly brought the thali but again I had to wait or call them for the second serving of rice...untill and unless you call them and ask they will not get any food which I felt is not a proper service. Money: The thali was about ‚Çπ130 which is a decent price and ‚Çπ140 for the fish fry which is very high for the quantity that they gave. OVERALL EXPERIENCE: 2.5/5

First impressions as we entered - renovation work with lot of hammering sound, which was not so welcoming and a lady holding broom and staring at us... Anyways, we had come to eat and didn‚Äôt waist a minute. We entered and ordered the specials straight away as the menu fell short of options. We ordered chicken fry(made with curry leaves) for starters, Roti and chicken curry and then Nilgiri mutton biryani, which were the only options available, except for meals. Since there were hardly any guests even at 1:30pm, we were hoping our food would arrive quick. Sadly, our order took longer than expected and there were more flies than people in what appeared to be dark and shady place. So finally we changed tables and shifted to a decent looking table hoping the food would arrive any moment. After a long pause the chicken fry was served, it was not up to my expectations - as there were too many pieces prepared with what appears to be chicken skin. Then roti and chicken curry arrived which was very basic and finally the biryani arrived straight from the Nilgiris. Except for the plain white rice, nothing else was warm and the mutton pieces were cold as ice. That was definitely not what I had expected. We couldn‚Äôt bear any longer. We gave our feedback to the staff/management hoping they would at least make things better for future customers. Cheers!"

87-281,87,281,Poor,"163 Reviews , 704 Followers",Karthik Reddy Bandi,2,"Me along with my family went to Vana Bhojanam for lunch on Sunday. I wanted my family especially my wife to enjoy Telugu hospitality and cuisine. We ordered for Andhra meals, Karvepaku Kodi and Mutton Fry. We wanted to order for Karvepaku Prawns and fish fry but were told that they were not available. It is criminal to not serve some dishes on what is a small menu especially on a Sunday! The restaurant was empty when we came in at 12:30 pm. It was almost half full during our meal. Ambiance ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî Initial impressions were that the place was small and ordinary and the pricing justifies that. The outdoor seating tries to give that feeling of the woods but I still don‚Äôt get how those old scrap vehicles used for decor fit within the concept. It instead uses up space and doesn‚Äôt make sense. Andhra Meals: ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî The meals has Rice served along with Dal, Sambar, Rasam, Aloo Fry, Okra Curry and Curd. We were not served flavoured rice. It was only at the end of the meal when we asked about it that we had the dish served. We had to wait for more than 20 minutes for the meals to be served after the starters. We were told that the rice was not yet ready and this was at 1:15 :-O Once the food was finally served, The rice was lukewarm and so were all the dishes that were served alongside. We asked for ghee and the guy took atleast 10 mins to bring it to the table. My bad experience with their service did not just end there. I was served two cups of rasam instead of sambar and the waiter spent another 10 minutes replacing it. During our meal we had to progressively wait for each of the refill of dal, sambar, rasam or vegetable fry. I could not entirely blame the waiter. They were serving all the refills by replacing the finished cups of dal etc with the new cups. This doesn‚Äôt make sense. Usually the servers carry each of the dish - Dal/sambar etc in a huge tumbler and pour generously when asked for a refill. Their concept of serving itself did not seem practical. It makes diners wait for a quantity that it not a whole lot. It felt cheap and ruined the experience. It just doesn‚Äôt feel right waiting with our hands drying in anticipation of a refill. That killed the experience. The food was sub-par. The Dal tasted good. It was thick and comforting. It went great with the ghee. The sambar was okay. It did not have the standing out flavour of the vegetables or the dal. Serving Aloo as the vegetable fry felt shocking. I never had Aloo fry as the only veggie fry in an Andhra meal. The rasam did not feel like a flavour bomb. The Okra curry tasted yuck. It was sour and we just could not finish a mouthful of it. Some of the fryums were soggy. The feel of an Andhra meal was missing. Hot rice served with piping hot curries with a smooth service is the least I expect from a restaurant serving meals. The only saving grace of an otherwise horrible experience was the Karvepaku kodi and Mutton Fry. Karvepaku Kodi and Mutton Fry ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî Both the dishes tasted absolute yum. The chicken was well marinated and doubly fried to give that yummy succulence and flavour. The mutton fry had perfectly cooked mutton and crispy bits of mutton at the end providing some lovely texture. These were the saving grace of an otherwise horrible experience. But again, we came to the restaurant for the meals and the experience was easily amongst my worst. To make matters worse, the owner thrashed one of their servers when the table in front of us complained! It felt like we were in a hostile environment. Even after the meal, we were incorrectly billed 3 times at the end despite us telling what we ordered. I would go with 2 out of 5 for Vana Bhojanam. The service was poor, cheap and shoddy. The only saving grace was their non-veg starters."

They're extremely good when it comes to south Indian dishes, especially starters. We had Kodi vepudu - Stir fried south Indian style chicken with curry leaves, teen chillies and hint of pepper. Extremely tasty and very well spiced. Fish fry - Not very good, average. This was deep fried and the fish was fresh. Mutton fry - Real good home taste. Succulent pieces of mutton. Very delicate and perfectly marinated. Bhindi fry - This was deep fry bhindi with besan. Good option for vegetarians. For main course we had Thali which had a lot of items. Sambar - Very good and a rich taste. Tomato aloo curry - Very tasty, well spiced. Pappy - I'm a huge fan of Dal, so this can be a little based. Daal was thick and flavoursome. Will go really well with rice. They also had a lot of other items I did not try in their thali. And here's the surprise. They serve biriyani in Thali! Biryani that is real good, subtle and had rightly flavored neat/ Chicken. My friend had suggested me to try the biriyani with ghee. And Oh God that was heaven on earth. In the curries I had tried Mutton curry. I am a huge fan of south Indian non veg curries. Nice , spicy and tangy. For desserts we had Gulab Jamun which was decent, could have been softer. And another dessert local to Andhra/ Telangana. It was puran Poli stuffing ( Daal and jaggery) inside wada batter which was fried. I tasted it. It was good and not very sweet.

For deserts had their poornam boorelu which was like a bhajiya filled with something like puran(jaggery made) we used to have in puran puri...

Newbie in town but serving some of the amazing and pocket friendly Andhra thali's. Visited this place few days back for dinner with my gang as heard a lot about this place by many foodies. Ambiance is quite decent and pricing too. Have tried all their dishes but the üåü one needs to be mentioned earlier which was Vanabhojanam special karivepaku Kodi, Mutton liver fry & Poornam Boorelu. Starters: Started with karivepaku Kodi which I already decaled as a star was great and must try. Fish fry was decent as I am not a fish lover but as told by my friends it was good. Mutton fry was nice, pieces were really tender and perfect spicy level, Prawns iguru was great too but the only issue is the pieces should have been little bigger but taste wise it was great. Main Course: We tried their amazing thali which is the focus point on this place, sambhar & pappu were really good. Rasam was decent so as the bhindi (lady finger) fry. Chicken biryani was decent and little different which we usually had in other outlets. Dessert: Gulab jamun was OK, it was little hard whereas it should be soft. Another was üåü i.e. Poornam Boorelu which I had for the first time. I had it with ghee and alone as well but it was much better then ghee on the top. Simply loved this dish at this place. A Must try but with ghee. Overall we had an amazing time at this place and will recommend to all to visit this place if you are Andhra style food lover.

The place looks beautiful, it is spacious and open. Decorated with beautiful bulbs, artificial leaves and bamboo sticks which gives a foresty look. It's rare for people to find good food at lower prices in areas lie Jubilee Hills and Banjara hills.. Vanabhojanam is now the option. Simple Menu | Affordable pricing. Started off with vanaBhojanam specials Karivepaku Kodi. Fine pieces of boneless chicken fried with a coating of curry leaf spiced flavours. For me this was the Star of all the starters I had at this place. Really loved the Karivepaku flavour and the meat was too soft to eat. Served fresh and hot. Firsh Fry, they use a fish which is regionally known as ""Katla"". I love fish starters, but I did not have too much of this because I dont feel like wasting my time on pulling out the bones from the fish. Tasted a bit of it and I could realize it was good and perfectly marinated. Bhindi fry starter was good and crispy. Prawns Iguru, Andhra style tiny prawns. This was prepared good but the taste was salty due to the prawns being small in size. As prawns were small, the taste was more of the coating. Mutton Fry, Loved this one. Succulent pieces of mutton and made south indian style. It was higher on the spicier side. Mutton liver fry was something I never had outside my home. This had the same taste what my mum prepares at home. The Non veg thali has so much to offer. I forgot all the names of thali contents. I tried everything from the thali and taste was really good. Mutton and Chicken Gravies were prepared very well. Biryanis, tasted both chicken, Mutton and chicken fried Biryani. These were great in taste. Desserts: Gulab Jamun and Poornam Boorelu. Poornam boorelu was really went well with the Ghee that they offered on table. Also had that ghee with Biryani and biryani became more flavorful. Overall, left the place with great satisfaction. Shared a few feedback with owner Mr. Reddy and he assured that will be taken care of."

Ambience: resembles that of a highway South Indian Dhaba. Minimalistic and open air. Location: the left lane adjacent to ice-creamery that is situated in rd num 2 banjara hills (kbr park road) Food price: Very Economical Food: The menu is biased towards non vegetarians and boy do I love that! Appetizers: there are a lot of fried items. Karivepaku kodi: this was a crispy fried boneless chicken item. The best out of the lot! Crispy, oil-free and tasty. MUST TRY Mutton fry: comes garnished with cashews on top and is succulent, soft and very spicy. MUST TRY if you can handle the spice. Fish fry: this is with bone and is okay-ish to taste. The masala seemed less to taste. Prawn fry or prawn iguru: this was crispy as well but not as good as the chicken. Mains: MUST TRY Non veg thali: the mutton and chicken curry that comes in the thali is delicious. Bhindi fry is good as well. It is batter fried and crispy. The rest pf the bowls had sambar, daal, rasam, mint and coriander rice, etc. Fresh hot rice is served on the table with the thali. There is also a chutney on the side and a bowl of curd. Biryani: MUST TRY Both mutton and chicken biryani was extremely delicious and home-like with moderate amount of masala and spice level. Overall satisfaction: This place will give you much more than the price you pay for the food. Note: They also have pachhadis, podis and ghee placed on the table for you to enjoy with the thalis!

Finally got a chance to visit this place and the location of this restaurant is really good and easy to find which in itself will ease the customers to dine in without spending a lot of time finding the location. The first impression it gives is of the old style house or dhaba with decent seating arrangement keeping it neat and clean. It has both AC and Non-AC sections. A really nice place for family and friends. It was really great how the management helped us in serving food and recommending there best dishes so that we don‚Äôt miss the prime dishes of this place. Initially for starters we had Karivepaku Kodi which is deep fried crispy boneless chicken at its best. Later on Fish Fry and Shrimp fry were served which were decent in taste but I loved Karivepaku Kodi. After the round of starters we ordered Thali, Mutton Fry, Mutton Curry, Chicken curry, Mutton Biryani and Chicken Biryani. The Mutton Fry was packed with Masalas which would be amazing if served with Rotis. The Mutton Biryani was cooked with perfection keeping the right quantity of Masala which resulted in great taste. Finally I had the best part of the menu in my opinion was it‚Äôs Mutton Liver Fry which was made with great taste frying to its required tenderness with right quantity of masala. Will surely visit this place again for Mutton Liver Fry. Finally had Poornam Boorelu and Gulab Jamun which was a perfect end to the meal."

Then Vanabhojanam Special Karivepaku Royallu which is crispy fried shrimps with curry leaves. Then crispy Okra fry which is fried ladyfingers. The last in the starters was Mutton fry. The fried chicken and mutton are must try dishes here. Then we tried Special Andhra Thali, all the things was good and it had the authentic Andhra taste. I liked the Sambar and Dal. Then we also tried Chicken Biryani and Mutton Biryani. Despite being the Andhra restaurant, they served authentic Hyderabadi Biryani. Then in the last we had Deserts, which include Poornam Boorelu and Gulab Jamun. The Poornam Boorelu is the Andhra dessert which is similar to the Pooran Poli. comparestudio.com"

Located in the lane next to icecreamery, where Old Door was previously located. Decent interiors for a small area and lit up nicely. There are a few antiques like scooter, which were used in some of the Telugu films, the table top over a sewing machine.... The menu is simple and it delivers. Thali being it's pro, and it's reasonably priced at 130/- For the starters we had, Vanabhojanam special karivepaku chicken- am in love with this dish, probably best of the lot. It's crispy, it's spicy, a typical Andhra snack I would say. Rightly balanced too. Add a a dash of lemon and wow Vanabhojanam special karivepaku royyalu - all the spices were right and nice, I would have enjoyed it better, if the salt took a low note. Hitches do happen in the initial days, totally understandable. Mutton fry- if you are someone who loves spicy food, then this is for you. Fish fry- was good but the bones did tricky Thali is what this place is all about - proper Telugu food on a plate. There's a Roti pachadi to start with, I loved the coriander mint flavoured rice, okra fry needed salt, there's aloo curry, pappu, Sambhar, rasam and curd. All tasted pretty much like home cooked food. Also the Biryanis here are pretty good. For Desserts, Poornam boorelu- now this needs special mention, dip or dunk it with ghee and you are on cloud 9. Loved it totally. Gulab jamun- was okayish Whenever I need a quick meal or thali am gonna back üëß"

Like the say, the best things happen when you aren't planning for it. The place is adorned in shades of Blue and white and a few other colours might pop up here and there. It instantly creates a vibe as soon as you enter the lane, disconnecting you from the rest of the city. And the music they play, just adds up to that mood. Coming to food and drinks, there's just sandwiches and marmalades on the menu. And if you're a vegetarian, there's probably just 3 options to choose from.

Kubideh is basically tangy lamb patties which is served hot and Murgh pukh is herbed chicken, potato and lentil patties served hot. I have never been a fan of lamb sandwiches, but Kubideh just made me a fan of it. This sandwich was so juicy and delicious, I was just lost in that yummy taste.

Tastefully done up in accents of blue and white, with quaint bird houses doubling up as planters, the setup here is an inspiration :) The food does not disappoint either. The beautiful sublime kubideh on foccaccia is a must try, so is the bastani ice cream about which I have heard great things but haven't tried yet (out of stock on the night I visited, is there NO god ?!). Now,the only reason for the less than 5 star is the other sandwich I tried. The potato omelette sandwich on my first few bites seemed to be the stuff of which comfort food dreams are made of. But a couple more bites down, I started finding it a bit bland. BUT, and this has singlehandedly ensured that I will continue trying out the food here, is the response of the management (Moiz) when I communicated this. Instead of hiding behind the usual ""we will keep this in mind"" spiel, he instantly launched into a description of why the blandness in that dish could not be combated in a fell swoop. And the discussion that followed regarding alternative ways of spicing it up was so so exciting for an amateur chef like yours truly ! These guys also offer variants of coffee (which I did not try) and are going to introduce a specialised and rare Iranian tea set up (which I am looking forward to). Pretty good value for money as well. 'Nuff said. Go down, grab some grub and enjoy a whiff of Persia :) ProTip - Google is slightly misleading regarding the exact location, the food truck is parked at an alley accessible through the #788 entrance and has its own parking and seating."

We have experienced chaats, juices, quick bites from road side vendors and sometimes worry about hygiene, but the taste never disappoints us. Hyderabad‚Äôs food industry has been going through tremendous experiments with food streets across city and food trucks adding more value and diversity. In all this Sofrehh is a name to behold. Located in a beautiful and posh neighbourhood of Jubilee Hills, Sofrehh has a prime spot and may be the only food truck in that entire stretch. . The ambience of the place is so lovely with the pretty overhead lights over seating area. The theme is blue as they are all in festive mood. They serve gourmet sandwiches and it‚Äôs a Persian food truck, so the spices are yummy. Our orders were the Veg Falafel and Murgh Bozorgh. First thing you notice is the softness of the sandwich bread. It‚Äôs treated with oil again before baking and hence it turned out to be super soft and maybe the finest breads you taste. Falafel has patties made of chick peas with potato. It was delicious and when served hot they were absolute fun to eat. I really liked it better than the non veg Bozorgh. But Bozorgh was such pleasure and it had fewer patties than falafel. Hitting the right notes I recommend you guys to go out and explore this pretty little food truck. .

I love how very little space was smartly put to use to set it up and of course, the colour blue used to bring more emphasis. I went for a dinner food preview and with all the fairy lights it looked even better. The furniture and ambience are very easy going and homely and of course, the host/the owner/chef who came up with the menu and the entire concept (food truck) is very very hospitable and knowledgeable. He definitely knows his food well. It is all derived from his monther's recipes which as a family they've put together and the precision shows when you just have one bite of these brilliant sandwiches. The bread is soft and just melts as you chew and the sandwiches are also prepared on the spot and are served hot. so these are the things I've tried, 1. A 2 in 1 coffee - (Batsam - An imported coffee that comes from Dubai) I requested for a coffee with minimum or no sugar at all and this tasted amazing. I must say that its a better version of a straight-up black coffee. 2. Veg Falafel sandwich - The only vegetarian sandwich I've had. It was absolutely delicious. Perfectly made falafels served with some veggies. 3. Kubideh sandwich - Yummy Lamb patties served in-between very tasty and soft bread. 4.AOTA - All of the above sandwich - The best and tastiest one among all. A sandwich that has bread covered with an omelette, cheese and a filling of all meats combined. This sandwich is a no-brainer. A must try for sure. 5. Murgh Kobideh Tukhmeh - This is a chicken version of the Kubideh and is served with an omelette over the bread. 6.Dessert - Classic Bastani - Their in-house ice cream made by them from scratch, the flavours of saffron and rosewater are just impeccable together. It's interesting to see how these sandwiches are prepared, especially the ones that have omelettes over the bread. I will definitely recommend this place not only because of the quality of food that they offer but also for the passion they have to experiment and improve each day. I hope they keep it up and keep feeding us the yummy sandwiches and many more things to come as a part of their menu. bitesizedjournal.com"
88-20,88,20,Very Good,"2 Reviews , 8 Followers",Rohit Ratish,4,"Based on the recommendation made by a friend, me and my pals decided to stop by the sofrehh food truck in jubilee hills. The past experiences with food trucks have not been the best and to be honest, they've always been a little underwhelming and disappointing. Appearences and Comfort A - Visually appetizing Sofrehh is no different in design. It's a conventional food truck but what sets it apart in aesthetics is that it's parked in a little alley beside a building on the main road. The team has taken decent efforts into making the alley look festive and decorative. There's enough seating for over a dozen people which is fairly enough I guess. The lighting is fabulous, especially at night and the seating is moderately comfortable. The place, despite being open is neat, well maintained and doesn't smell bad. The traffic emissions luckily doesn't reach the seating are which doesn't turn off the eating experience. This food truck is strategically placed to give you the best experience that they can, so points for the effort. Da Food A - It's better than you expect The menu is not absurdly large or overstuffed which is how it's supposed to be for a food truck. Focusing on a few options and making them work is more vital. The menu is not large enough to confuse you and it's not too small that you are coerced to eat something you don't want to. There's an equal amount of sandwich options for veg, chicken and mutton options. As we went on a group, we made sure that we got at least one sandwich from each category and boy was it a treat. The cold veg sandwich was nothing special but it was one of the better cold sandwiches that I had eaten. It was large and serviceable and wouldn't disappoint you. As for the chicken sandwich that I was most looking forward to, it turned out better than I had anticipated. There wasn't too much grease, the veggies weren't overstuffed and the meat was just the right amount. It was decently cooked and the mild flavour gelled really well with the temperature of the toast. However, the stars of the show were the two mutton sandwiches we ordered. I was really skeptical of eating a mutton sandwich because I surprisingly had never eaten one. I didn't know how well it would work with a sandwich and I was minutes away from having my mind blown. The meat in these sandwiches were tender, smoky, flavourful and juicy. But most importantly, they really complimented the sandwich experience. These two sandwiches were the best I've had this year. But that's not saying much because I haven't had too manyüòÖ. Still, take my word for it. The food is good here. Sorry, I'm unable to name the dishes but they were the recommendations made by the owner. Be sure to ask him if you want to take my word and play it safe. We also tried out three samples of marmalade at his request. They were rich in flavour but I personally feel that they were overdone. One of the three was decent but I don't recommend that you go for either of the three. Stop somewhere else in the area to quench your sugar thirst. This place is for sandwiches unless you are actively seeking new marmalades. I wouldn't stop you if you are. The Servitude Experience A - Not concerning Again, service is not the selling point of food trucks. It's just a bunch of people in a cramped truck, squeezing through tight spaces and making edible stuff for you that costs money. There's a bunch of menus by the truck window and you're expected to walk up there, spend a few minutes going over the limited eating options, wrestle with your brain to make the choice and finally give in and tell the chef what you want. It's a simple process. However, there's some extra staff here and the owner's present too. They can even come up to the table if you want them to and they'll also help you with making a decision if that seems to be a problem for you. It definitely increases the overhead for a food truck but it's more convenient for us. My money though... A - It's a fair exchange Once you see the serving size of these sandwiches, you'll look up the 'shut up and take my money' meme and slap it on the truck counter while greedily eat the sandwich on your hand. While they're large, they're cut into even pieces that are convenient to hold and eat. And to top it all off, they're pretty good. We didn't get down to order marmalades so we don't know how much of it is offered. However they're more expensive than the sandwiches which average between 150-200. The marmalades are a tad bit expensive and based on the taste, I personally think that no less than a jar would be worth the money. However, there's a good chance that you might like it so do ask for a sample before you decide to order. Stand up for the verdict All in all, this was a good experience. It was open so late in the night and still we got a good dining experience. They were even tolerant of our bizarre antics and smiled through it all. The place is not a fallen fragment of heaven and could use a little improvement in each category but it's definitely done more than it is supposed to. Everything was good and I'll leave a score out of 10 which is more flexible than zomato's five star system. Score - 9/10 I do recommend this place. If you're suddenly craving a heavy sandwich for some reason, try driving up to this place. It's definitely worth it."

The ambiance was delightful despite the place being tiny (part of the credit goes to the Dean Martin songs playing in the background üôà). We ordered 2 sandwiches, one Penir Pukh and one Potato and Cheese omlette. I had high hopes but having turned pescatarian more than a year ago, I also deep down was thinking how the vegetarian sandwich would be just ok compared to the long list of meat options. The Penir Pukh came first and oh my god I was surprised. The bread was super soft, the patty inside was even more delicate making everything melt in mouth. One could definitely see that the time taken to make a sandwich was not compromised. The bread though soft was crispy on the edges and I think this would be the best bread I have tasted in a while. The potato and cheese omlette took a while but the music, the atmosphere, the weather as well as the aroma in that tiny enclosure lead to such amazing conversations that I did not mind a bit. The sandwich came with a very humble apology which frankly speaking was not even required! The potato and egg omlette was again a different experience all together. Any place that can serve something which is as lightly seasoned as that sandwich really trusts their cooking abilities and this place sure does. Loved every last bite of the sandwich. Then came the interesting icecream on the menu- Classic Bastani ( Persian saffron and rose water). I saw that on the menu and knew that I wanted it however consider it my luck that there was not enough left. The owner however was kind enough to scrape out the remaining bits and serve that to us so that we could atleast taste the ice-cream. And boy, what an amazing way to end the meal. Me and my husband had a wonderful time here and going forward this is going to be our favourite date-night spot for sure."

Exactly what happened with the Sofrehh They have got mom's fortune recipes of delicious Persian sandwiches, which you won't get anywhere across the country for sure and the sofrehh has a huge success. With all the blessings of their mom, they got an idea with crazy passion to open a food truck at any corner, but there were not satisfied to standing at corners of roads, as they deserved the better spot a best place, and then they came up to an brilliant idea to turn out the food truck into a bistro and find this parking space and transformed it to a wonderful bistro at 788 Avenue Road No: 36 Jubilee hills.

The Murgh was bang on but the orange and the apple peel sandwiches are crazy I liked them a lot and must visit place for sure.

But the foodie in me can take me anywhere if the content is worth going the distance. Even then, if someone tells me there is a food truck at 36, Jubilee hills that serves great sandwiches, i don't think i would be excited. Because one, i am not a fan of sandwiches and two, 7 kilometers for a sandwich is not my ideal quick bite! But then, there are places that beat me with excellence. I have given up on my oldest habits and destroyed my own austerity giving in to these innovative and flawless ideas! Sofrehh is the latest myth-buster in my life. A food truck that serves high-quality sandwiches is all it sounds like but just one look at the place was all it took to convince me this is not just about sandwiches! The way this place has been set up and decorated only shows the vision of the man behind this mesmerizing place, Arash! He knew its going to work, i don't know how! I took my own sweet time to visit Sofrehh because i wanted to see how people receive it. As expected, it was a huge hit within weeks of its opening! So finally when I got a chance to visit the place that i had seen a hundred times on FB and Insta, the Deja Vu was hard to avoid but then it was the food that played the role of surprise element for me. I had read enough about their Gourmet Sandwiches but they still surprised me with their never-before ingredients and flavors. We started with Batsam Coffee that they are importing all the way from Dubai. As expected, it was one strong, refreshing coffee that can't get better. The first Sandwich that came was a Koubideh Sandwich. The first thing that catches your eye is the Bread that is used. Besides looking Gorgeous, the bread was super soft and fresh. Koubideh Sandwich comes with a tangy lamb patty and a lot of other green goodness! It was a fresh new experience for my palate! The patty was softer than our Shami kebab and was juicier! Overall i loved the start! The next one was Murgh Kobideh Tukhmeh which had a chicken patty and was topped by an omelet! It had a soothing buttery taste and the chicken patty was so lite, i felt I'm eating a veg sadnwich Next was Veg Falafel Sandwich, a vegetarian's delight! Fully loaded falafel Sandwich that just fills your mouth with a hundred flavors. One would suffice for a lunch or dinner. Then came the big momma of them all, the sandwich that is named ""AOTA - All Of The Above"". As the name suggests, this bad boy has a little of everything on the menu, making it a giant of a Sandwich. You have to be born with a great appetite to savor this humongous sandwich. Its a double-decker that comes with Minced meat filling, ot of cheese, an omelet among several other fillings! This one was my star of the evening. Don't miss this one!. Ended the Persian feast with their amazing rose and cinnamon flavored ice cream. Overall it's a place you cannot afford to miss. This place deserves a place in every list of ""Things to do in Hyderabad"""

That it is a foodtruck registers quite late into my mind, you actually feel like you were transported into a street in a different country (Iran). Kudos to the designer, what a brilliant use of space. This is the place if you want to take someone special to, the ambience is just that lovely. Coming to the food, the taste pallete is definitely in for a lot of new variety. We ordered 3 main courses ‚Äì Veg falafel (beautifully done), Murgh Purkh (my husband‚Äôs favourite) and their classic Chicken-egg-cheese sandwich(my fav). The bread was very soft and rich with a lot of addons, the stuffing in all was fresh and healthy. I personally cant get enough of the chicken-egg-cheese sandwich. One could wish for more drinks to compliment other than their coffee. Loved their classic bastani icecream. Like I said before, the tastes are all unique, definitely worth trying. Don‚Äôt waste your time in waiting for a right day to check this out, the place itself will brighten up your usual boring weekday ‚Äì it did to me!

I went around lunch time to try much of the stuffs on offer. I was scouting a lot of stalls and the food trucks out there. There was this blue colored truck at one corner which was hogging most of the crowds. It looked one of the popular stalls out there in the event. I was silently checking it out and the menu wondering what to order. The owner (didn't know his name but he was a really cool guy though) came to my help and helped me out with the menu. I ordered for a Murgh Kubideh Tokhme. Absolutely didn't have any idea how it will be like taste and look wise. Got my order delivered after some 10 minutes. Considering the crowd, it was rather quick I would say. Just the first look of the sandwich would make one drool. It was wonderfully made. The Murgh Kubideh is a Chicken & Egg sandwich along with cheese made in their custom bread. It was one of the most awesome sandwiches I've had. Tasted so nice and was just silken smooth. Don't be deceived by the size of it, it fills you up pretty well. Wish I had more space on my stomach that day to try out their other items. Let's see if I can drive out to Jubilee hills one day during my stay here in Hyderabad. I wish we had eateries like Sofrehh in Chennai."

Well Sofrehh is exactly that to GastroHogger. Two failed attempts to try their gourmet sandwiches as they sold out, today destiny made Sofrehh the destination. Enough has been spoken about their gourmet sandwiches, simple and classic ingredients, amazing flavors and still pocket-friendly. I now can officially vouch for it as well. tucked inside the building at Daily Dose Bar in Jubilee Hills, this gem of a food truck is setup that's as inviting as it gets minimalistic decor, cute light arrays, blue everywhere and very well lit more like European by lane on the street cafes. Full score for keep it simple n ample. Tried the following (in order my crav(z)e levels: #TheAOTA aka ""All Of The Above"" is amalgamation of egg, chicken and cheese and potato - Its a gastronomical symphony.. Taste it to believe it #Kubideh - Favorite among crowd, Tangy lamb patties based sandwich and this was classic and amazing flavors. You gulp them in a jiffy #MurghKubidehTokhme aka MKT - Persian style minced chicken egg sandwich with cheese. I mean this was the most silkiest sandwich your palate get to romance. Alongside were hot n super fresh #Cappacino and to finish it off in style #BastaniSonnati - saffron and rosewater flavored ice cream. After those hot n guey sandwiches,this one cools your palate and your inner soul from first bite. IF you think the quality, quantity, ingredients, keeping it simple is what makes Sofrehh it is, wait till you meet the man behind the wheels Mehdi Arash Naseeruddin. His energy and excitement is infectious and a chat with him sipping a pipin hot cappucino and grab a bite of their sandwich, it becomes a memory and that to me is icing on the cake kind of experience. Overall Sofrehh has sure trying to perfect their recipe of success and I pray it to become ""LEGENDARY"" gourmet sandwiches in the land of Biryani and dilse Nazar na lagey <3 gastrohogger.com"

The overall setup is very praiseworthy. The place offers a variety of uniquely made sandwiches that are in special breads which have olives in them. Kubideh is a toothsome sandwich with their secret sauces and chopped lamb which makes it delicious and made me loose myself in it. Murgh Pukh and Seebzamini Mozzarella were really good and they were really loved by our group when we visited this fabulous place. Murgh Pukh was a chicken patty filled with great flavours while Seebzamini Mozzarella, as the name suggests, was filled with layers of cheese. We ended our meal with their signature Bastani Ice Cream, which is a unique blend of milk, right amount of sweetness full of saffron threads and topped with crushed pista. It was incredible!

We ordered Murgh Pukh, Cutty Murgh, Kubideh, Shah Pukh Seebzamini Mozzarella and Veg Falafel. Murgh pukh was something new; it contained herbed chicken, potato and lentil patties. It was really good in taste. The coated bread was really perfect and filled with vegetables and sauces. Then we moved to Cutty Murg, which became my favroite. The chicken was perfectly cooked with well balanced spices. In between I got up and took a walk around the place. I had a chance to look at the making of all, and it was very good in authentic Persian style. Kubideh was there signature dish and it is a must try. It was just yumm! Perfectly marinated and juicy. Then we had Veg Falafel. I and my friends have had it at many places, but this was something else. I would recommend all to have it. By this time we were all full, but they brought Seebzamini Mozzarella, which is a famous and most selling dish. Coated with cheese and filled with crispy potato and egg. If you are a cheese lover then you should definitely try this. We ended our meal with their handmade ice-cream Bastani Sonnati. It was made with Pesian saffron and rose water.

The moment we got in the lane where Sofrehh is located, we felt as if we were somewhere in Europe. The setup is commendable. Coming to the food, we ordered a couple of Kubideh Sandwiches ofcourse followed by a few others namely Cutty Murgh, Murgh Puk, Shah Puk, Veg Falafel and their new addition Seebzamini Mozzarella. Kubideh Sandwiches were outstanding with amazing spices and various sauces which made it so good. Special mention to their bread which is equally good and has olives on it. Murgh Puk and Seebzamini Mozzarella were the other two which became an instant hit among our group. Murgh Puk is a tender chicken patty filled with flavours in the same bread while the Seebzamini Mozzarella in my opinion is the best of the lot as I never had anything like it before. It contains egg, two levels of cheese, some meat, a few veggies and to top it off a lot more grilled cheese on the sandwich which makes it mouthwatering.

Shah Pukh The lamb was very viscous, may be that's how the recipe is but it was very bland. Clearly the marinade didn't release the flavours. Sad sad Falafel. This was the only saving grace. The patty managed to shine out inspite of the fat bread. Never ever."

When I first saw the food truck, thought I shall go there someday and when I heard good reviews about their sandwiches, I wanted to grab a bite ASAP. I kept searching for them on the old spot, ended up disappointed for few days.Fortunately, I got to know that they have moved to another place. One day, after looks of searching,I found the address and I was amazed as I walked into the lane, where the food truck was parked at the end of the alley. It had quite an amazing ambiance, it has made the whole search experience worthwhile. With lights and frames and small planters on the walls of the alley, it kinda made the place quite festive and beautiful. As I sat there checking the menu, the host greeted me and asked me whether I was a first timer and whether I would like a veg or non veg sandwich. He is quite helpful, in suggesting me their most loved sandwich in both veg and non veg. I have decided to take KUBIDEH (non veg) and a cappuccino and was enjoying the evening breeze and vibe in the alley. When my order came through, I can still remember the first bite of KUBIDEH. It was quite delicious and fell in love with that sandwich and decided that it would definitely be on my last night food craving list from now on. As I ate my sandwich, I have seen people waiting for their orders to come, by making conversations. I believe with an delicious food, the hosts have careful put in their best in creating the ambience to bring in a positive and wonderful vibe to the place. As I was eating my sandwich, Hosts have personally asked for my opinion on their sandwich and suggested to try their other sandwiches too. As I left the place, with a delicious meal and good vibe. I personally congratulated and complimented them, for the food and the ambiance. Told them that I would certainly visit them soon and try their other sandwiches. I have been there numerous to date, The hosts are such an amazing people. One late night, he personally done an sandwich , after his closing time, because he didn‚Äôt want to send me away hungry. I was so moved by his sweet gesture and would remember it forever. Thank you guys !!! You guys are absolutely amazing and wonderful people.... keep going... Good Luck"

They have separate pans for Veg and Non Veg which was a good Option on a Food truck. Started with Murg Oliveh: it's a Cold sandwich, with great The filling of Shredded chicken and potato, along with corn, Green peas and Mayo. The bread was really fluffy and soft, not over baked. Slight paprika sprinkled on bread. A Very delicious and Perfect cold sandwich. Best I had! Kubideh Sandwich: The bread was Very Fluffy, but this was little different. Oregano and Olives were added on the Bread. The stuffing was amazing, The lamb patties were really good m, soft and Tangy, not too spicy. The veggies like Tomato and Pickles (just like cucumber) . Delicious and A lovely Sandwich üëå this was my favourite here. Cutty Murg: Another great Sandwich. The chicken inside was really good, with freshly cut veggies and Mayo. Loved this one as well. They do have some Amazing Coffees as well, Which are Are From Dubai. The name of the Brand is Batsam. I tried Black coffee with sugar which was Really strong, but it was Refreshing. Had Cappuccino as well, Hot and Creamy. Delicious coffees, Recommended! The breads here are different and very fluffy which were really good. Well presented sandwiches on a Butter Paper. The packing of Take away is very neat. We had a Ice cream called Bastani sonati: It is an Iranian Cream made with Saffron, rose water, Vanilla and Pistachios.

The pretty lights and the cozy alley with the cobble stone pathway had me feeling like Id turned the corner and walked into a little bit of Europe. The soft music in the background felt so romantic. We ordered three sandwiches The Kubideh- Lamb patty in an olive bread with pickled cucumbers and tomato slices. The Lamb patty had a meat ball like consistency. The murgh oliveh- Cold sandwich made of paprika bread stuffed with shredded chicken, peas and corn, potato etc. Shah pukh- Super soft chicken patty with texture similar to a galouti kebab but with a completely different taste. With tomatoes and pickled cucumbers. The breads were softer than a baby's bottom. Absolutely fresh. The sandwiches almost melt in your mouth. Each sandwich is labelled with a sticker so you don't get confused. They also have imported instant coffees. Black coffee- Pretty good and Basic Cappuccino- Loved this one. Their signature ice cream Bastani Sonati with rose essence, saffron and pistachios was absolutely delightful. A unique flavour. Must try. Verdict- This was my first experience with Persian food. I loved how the herbs and spices didn't overpower the flavor of the meats in the patties. The sandwiches are light and easy on the tummy. Quite filling too.

Jubilee hills has places which has beautiful interiors, serves different cuisines and can be comfortable enough for long get togethers but none of them are open after 11. Then here comes the Batman to the rescue - Sofrehh the food truck. What used to be at a different location now has found its sweet spot at this location. The place: The tungsten lights, the blue and white combination with simple wooden furniture, the canopy when it rains, the stone floors makes it an absolutely beautiful place to be at. The things they serve: Not a huge menu but absolutely effective - Hot and cold, Veg and Non veg gourmet sandwiches , Maramalade( no preservatives) , Coffee's and Ice cream( on availability) Having taken a break from Zomato for a long time and just uploading pictures I was wondering what place deserves a review and here is Sofree - One strong recomendation after a hazaar visits at all the odd hours and it has delivered everytime. If you are a Vegetarian - Do try the Falafel sandwich ( Foccasia kind of bread) and ask for extra mayo sauce and you will love it. They have another Masala bread( red paprika on a very soft bread) that literally melts in your mouth. try the Pennir Sandwich on that. If you are a fan of heavy cold sandwiches give the Penir Oliveh a try. Separate veg and non veg grills to respect the sensitivities of people is a big plus. They have readymade coffee's too with 3-4 varieties which come in a heat proof plastic container and taste good.( Water based). But then if you plan to end your meal with a dessert they have their secret weapon which is not on the menu the saffron based ice cream with rose water and topped with Pistachios which will blow you away. It is home made and does not have preservatives as well which makes it even more appetizing. Priced perfectly( 200-250Rs), beautiful place, food presented really well with clear marking of the dish name makes this one of the few places which has got its game absolutely spot on. They are available on food delivery apps as well for convenience. Do try them! I wish to give them 4.5/5 but Zomato does not have an option üôà facebook.com"

Where u have such small cafes with small seating for groups and music being played in background. Coming onto the food. We order sandwiches. Cuttymurgh and Veg falafal were the best of all the 4 different sandwiches we ordered. They us focaccia bread for there sandwich. Coffee which they serve is Batsam instant coffee, it's good. But the best part which I truly like was the courteous nature of the owner or person who was there looking after. They are perfect host.

The place is very well lit up and has great ambience with jazz music playing in the background. We ordered 3 different types of non-veg sandwiches - Cutty Murgh, Kubideh and Shah-pukh and a coffee on the owner's recommendation. The rest of us were fine with cokes. The only sandwich that was okayish was Cutty Murgh, as both the lamb ones were just not worth it. And mind you all these sandwiches are pretty highly priced. I personally would pay around 150ish for the kind of sandwiches we ordered as I felt 200 plus is a bit high for these sandwiches. And the coffee my friend ordered was just not worth 90 bucks. It is basically an instant coffee which is imported from Dubai. Nothing extra. So in short a a decent place to have a late night snack when nothing else is open. PS: The bread of the sandwiches is really nice and they bake it themselves."

Just the one feedback is I'd recommend the cooks to use gloves. That's all. We went as a group and all of us had a good time.

It was all over my Instagram suddenly, and was too tempting to pass. Sure enough, the place was just as I had pictured to be in my head from the photos. üá¨üá∑Although promoted as a Persian bistro, it felt Greek owing to the use of subtle blue and white shades. Comfortable seating, under the evening sky and adequately bright incandescent hue from the bulbs created the most beautiful atmosphere! üòç This was made complete by the mellow Jazz playing üé∂. The best part for a first timer trying a new cuisine? The small menu. It was quite easy to order, after actually understanding the differences. I had: ü•™ CUTTY MURGH - Soft and juicy ground chicken, herb marinated stuffed between a heavenly Olive Focaccia bread, along with some veggies and mayo. ü•™ SHAH-PUKH - Everything exactly the same, with mutton in place of chicken. It tasted slightly different, and unique. From what I learned, Sofrehh bake their own bread, without the use of any artificial preservatives and chemicals. This was evident in the smooth texture and melt in the mouth of the focaccia breads! üçû Another thing appreciated is the eco-friendly nature of operations. Open cardboard boxes used to serve, and paper bags for takeaway! ‚ôªÔ∏è The location and timings are perfect to say it's one of those places that truly adds an element to Hyderabad's nightlife! üïë Great place to grab a gourmet sandwich or some coffee on the run, or just sit down and unwind amidst the calm. üòå They have homemade marmalades and ice creams which I hope to try on a subsequent visit. üç¶ A suggestion would be to include half portions.

Cutty murgh and Shah-pukh. I really liked both of them. But I really have to say about the Shah-pukh. It has the lamb patties. I don't really prefer lamb on a regular basis. But I just loved it. The meat was spiced, seasoned and cooked perfectly. The patty just melts in your mouth. I'm not at all exaggerating. You should not miss this when you visit them. I did like the Cutty murgh but Shah-pukh stole the show. I was not able to try the others because one sandwich is totally enough and is so fulfilling. Yes, I did not eat two of them on my own.

Following the greek style of blue and white spaces, it gives a pleasant feel. Coming to the food itself. Having a limited menu actually made it quite easy to choose but I do hope they keep changing/adding stuff else it's going to be difficult to create sticky customers. As me and my wife are not a big fan of cold sandwiches we both opted for veg falafel. Served in a cardboard plate, we got two pieces of veg falafel nicely wrapped and labelled (good job guys, avoids confusion of all sorts). As soon as the food was served we felt it was quite expensive for a small place but luckily the food was quite filling for the both of us. All of a sudden we are served with two more pieces of the veg falafel, baffled we were. Then we realised that one portion has two pieces and our tummy was full with just one portion, now we felt the price was quite justified. Coming to the taste, the olive foccacia used for veg falafel was buttery, soft and almost melted in the mouth. The chickpea patty was freshly made adding to the taste. Mayo was quite well balanced. Overall, felt simple but all the ingredients blended in well and the falafel felt just perfect. One small suggestion though. How about adding a half portion at Rs. 125? Feels light on the pocket and is quite filling for someone like me :) I guess I will be back sometime soon to try out other options in their menu. Having went there after hogging some delicious gelato elsewhere we couldn't really try out much today. All the the best to the guys running the show. It looks like a bold new attempt that depicts your hard work! I also appreciate the fact that neither the wrapping around the food nor the take away bag nor anything else had any plastic, keep it up! (go green). PS: we eventually had to opt for a takeaway for one portion as we couldn't eat it all there."

To begin with, I am a real big connoisseur of authentic Persian food and I have been ruing the lack of a single authentic Persian restaurant in Hyderabad ever since I moved here. I keep scouring Zomato regularly for anything that might seem to be authentic Persian and a few weeks back when I came upon Soffreh, I decided to give it a try. At that time they were located at a different spot. The sandwich was so good that I had to return back next week. Only the location had changed and it is now better. The food truck is parked by the side of a building and with the lights and seats the owners have created a beautiful ambiance that you can actually enjoy your evening of eating out. Coming to the main attraction the food - I tried the Koobideh Sandwich on both occasions and also the Cutty Murgh on the second. The Koobideh is my preferred choice. I have never come across a lamb patty so tender and juicy, that it just melts in your mouth. They bake their own bread and that tells in the quality of the sandwich. It is the softest, most flavorful bread you would have had ever. I have just found my favorite dish in all of Hyderabad and I will be back again and again to taste the Koobideh Sandwich.

Never have had such a fine bread . The chicken patty mixed with herbs was delicious too but I'm in awe of their breads . This one definitely deserves repeated visits . I am going for full marks for this joint . Do visit for some Exclusive Persian Sandwiches. Rating, Food -5/5 VFM -5/5 abthefoodie.wordpress.com"

I have tried almost everything from the menu and I am glad you guys exist. The quality of bread is worth the bucks and the best part is, it fills you like nothing else does! I could forget Biryani for this. Love Sofrehh!"

They fried falafel tikki in front of us and the bread was also soft and felt fresh! They have limited option, which makes it easier to choose from the menu. For a sandwich, 200 bucks is little expensive, and they can work on that part!"

The Kubideh and Cutty murgh are my favourite, the meat is grilled to perfection with some good salad but the bread steals the show for me. They have varieties of coffee and achaars as well. They are open from 5pm till 2am and are located at Jubilee hills road no. 37. Will be very easy to locate and very hard to not visit again!"

Falafel were really good but the sandwich wasn't that great for price of Rs 200/-, it had very less filling. Falafel were so good they could be made into a separate side dish. Also tried 3 in 1 coffee which was good. For the price of veg sandwiches they need to add more vegetables and two more falafels!"

Oh man, couldn't resist admiring the minute attention to each & every detail they have taken care while preparing!!! Finally found the goto place for my non-veg cravings!! Asked them to help me out with selecting the one which is a must try & I have tried the Kubideh ( Grated Meat ) & Shah-Puk ( Meat patty ). Both of these were simply amazing. Loved the bread coz it is of Olive flavour. Understood from them that the meat is cooked for 1 hour turning it into patty. Never tasted these sort of varieties. Value for Money : 5/5. Service : 5/5. Would love to visit again to try out the other varieties they got to offer me!"

Ordered cutty murgh.....and It was just awesome... the bread was soft and the chicken patty had a unique flavour. Will go back soon to try out the remaining items."

This Persian food truck serves the best sandwiches I've had till date. From the bread to the patty & the filling, the whole meal is made just to perfection with the right seasonings & the ingredients. We tried 3 sandwiches and our total was 660 must try: Cutty Sandwich: Blast of the flavors & spices put in the minced chicken patty!"
